He was also a highly decorated tank commander (Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Luxembourg Croix de Guerre) with the Third Army in the Second World War.

Perhaps the only person entitled to comment on Ecclesiastes is a cynic who has revolted from the world in disillusionment and disgust.&#34; &#34;If so,&#34; writes Michael Eaton, &#34;I qualify.&#34; Scholars have long wrestled with the gloomy pessimism and striking omission of any mention of Yahweh in this portion of the Wisdom literature. After setting forth the issues related to the text, authorship, date and canonicity, Eaton assesses the purpose and structure of the book. He then provides a passage-by-passage analysis that attempts to account for the oddities of the text and to show its contemporary relevance. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>Michael A. Eaton is Pastor-at-large, Chrisco Fellowship of Churches, Nairobi, Kenya"The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A.

Realizing that one of the most important gifts a parent can give a child is an honest picture of himself, Wyatt has decided to write his memoirs in the form of a letter on the occasion of Marlais' twenty-first birthday. With great clarity and economy he slowly discloses the events of his parents&#x2019; scandalous deaths in 1941, his teenage years living with his aunt and uncle, the joys of fatherhood, and what led to his abandoning his only daughter and her mother. Returning to Canada's Maritime provinces in his latest novel, What Is Left the Daughter, acclaimed author Howard Norman has created an unpredictable and absorbing story of an imperfect and tragic life at a turning point. This short and potent novel will leave readers replaying events and reconsidering Wyatt and the other unique characters long after reading the final pages. <i> --Lauren Nemroff</i> <br><br> <b>Product Description</b><br> Howard Norman, widely regarded as one of this country's finest novelists, returns to the mesmerizing fictional terrain of his major books--<i>The Bird Artist</i>, <i>The Museum Guard</i>, and <i>The Haunting of L</i>--in this erotically charged and morally complex story. <p>Seventeen-year-old Wyatt Hillyer is suddenly orphaned when his parents, within hours of each other, jump off two different bridges--the result of their separate involvements with the same compelling neighbor, a Halifax switchboard operator and aspiring actress. The suicides cause Wyatt to move to small-town Middle Economy to live with his uncle, aunt, and ravishing cousin Tilda. </p><p>Setting in motion the novel's chain of life-altering passions and the wartime perfidy at its core is the arrival of the German student Hans Mohring, carrying only a satchel. Actual historical incidents--including a German U-boat's sinking of the Nova Scotia-Newfoundland ferry <i>Caribou</i>, on which Aunt Constance Hillyer might or might not be traveling--lend intense narrative power to Norman's uncannily layered story. </p>Wyatt's account of the astonishing--not least to him--events leading up to his fathering of a beloved daughter spills out twenty-one years later. It's a confession that speaks profoundly of the mysteries of human character in wartime and is directed, with both despair and hope, to an audience of one. <p></p><p>An utterly stirring novel. This is Howard Norman at his celebrated best.</p><br> <br> <br>Amazon Exclusive: Howard Frank Mosher Reviews <i>What Is Left the Daughter</i> <br> <br> <b>Howard Frank Mosher is the author of 10 novels, his most recent book is <em>Walking to Gatlinburg</em>. Mosher's novel <em>A Stranger in the Kingdom</em> won the New England Book Award for Fiction and was made into a movie, as were his novels <em>Disappearances</em> and <em>Where the Rivers Flow North</em>. Read his guest review of <i>What Is Left the Daughter</i>:</b> <br> <p> </p><p>As my sainted grandmother used to say, with a hard look right straight at 12-year-old, misbehaving me, let's not mince words here. Okay, let's not: Howard Norman's new novel, <i>What Is Left the Daughter</i>, is the best story of love in the time of war I've ever read. And yes, that includes <i>Cold Mountain</i> and <i>A Farewell To Arms</i>.</p> <p>It's the early 1940s in Halifax, Nova Scotia. World War II, in all its fury, has come to Canada, as the dreaded German U-boats are sinking ferries and passenger ships just off the coast. In the meantime, 17-year-old Wyatt Hillyer's parents, caught up in a love triangle in which they've both fallen for a local switchboard operator and aspiring actress, have without warning leapt to their deaths "from separate bridges in Halifax on the same evening." Bereft and adrift, Wyatt soon moves to the tiny Bay of Fundy outport of Middle Economy, to work in his uncle's sled and toboggan shop.</p> <p>It will come as no surprise to Norman's readers to learn that, like Gabriel Garcia Marquez's jungle-village of Macondo, Middle Economy is a universe unto itself. What's more, its residents are every bit as strange and wondrous. For starters, there's kindly, plain-spoken Cornelia Tell, a one-woman Greek chorus of information and assessments. The town's aspiring stenographer, Lenore Teachout, takes down every conversation she overhears, and even transcribes the most awful war news over the radio. The casualty reports so distress Wyatt's eccentric uncle that he's papered the side of his toboggan shop with newspaper accounts of ships sunk by U-boats. Wyatt's beautiful, adopted cousin, Tilda, is obsessed by obituaries. Her dream in life is to become a "professional mourner" at the funerals of people who die without family or friends.</p> <p>When Hans Mohring, a likable young refugee from Hitler's Germany, visits Middle Economy and falls in love with Tilda, all hell breaks loose in the village, including the bloodiest and most shocking murder in recent fiction, the strangest (and, in places, funniest) courtroom sequence I've ever read, and the unspeakably sorrowful, total dissolution of the Hillyer family.</p> <p>Or does Wyatt's beloved family come totally unraveled in the onslaught of the war and its madness? Suffice it to say that <i>What Is Left the Daughter</i>, which is structured as a long letter from Wyatt, written in 1967 to his 21-year-old daughter, just may hold out the prospect of a transcendent love so powerful and enduring that it affirms the value and meaning of our lives even in the worst of times and despite all of our tragic flaws.</p> <p><i>What Is Left the Daughter</i> affirms what many of Howard Norman's readers have known since he published his magical first novel, <i>The Northern Lights</i>. Norman is most certainly one of America's three or four best novelists, with a uniquely wise and tolerant vision of his characters and all human beings everywhere. So let's not mince words. <i>What Is Left the Daughter</i> is a literary masterpiece that will, I guarantee it, live on in your heart, and mine, forever. </p> <br> <br><p>Seventeen-year-old Wyatt Hillyer is orphaned when his parents jump off two different bridges within hours of each other -- the result of their separate involvements with the same neighbor, a Halifax switchboard operator and aspiring actress.

On a clear day in winter, the battered corpse of Crispin Salvador is pulled from the Hudson River&#x2014;taken from the world is the controversial lion of Philippine literature.

The result is a rich and dramatic family saga of four generations, tracing 150 years of Philippine history forged under the Spanish, the Americans, and the Filipinos themselves. Finally, we are surprised to learn that this story belongs to young Miguel as much as to his lost mentor, and we are treated to an unhindered view of a society caught between reckless decay and hopeful progress.<br><br>Exuberant and wise, wildly funny and deeply moving, <i>Ilustrado</i> explores the hidden truths that haunt every family.

Inside: A recent diary (orange suede cover, hand-burnished a smooth caramel [inside: translations, riddles, jokes, poems, notes, other]). First editions (<i>Autoplagiarist</i>, <i>Red Earth</i>, <i>The Collected Fictions</i>, <i>The Enlightened</i>, et cetera). A dilapidated overnight suitcase (white Bakelite handle; stickers from hotels long shuttered [the lock is forced open with a table knife: the scent of pencil shavings and binding glue, a sheaf of photographs {slouching at the edges}, his sister's childhood diaries held together by a crumbling rubber band, pregnant manila envelopes {transcripts, newspaper clippings, red-marked drafts of stories, official documents }, a canvas portfolio {charcoal, graphite, ink sketches }, a battered set of Russian nesting dolls {the innermost missing}, other assorted miscellany {a Parker Vacumatic fountain pen, inherited medals from the Second World War, a lock of amber hair, et cetera}]).</p><p>*</p><p>My friend and mentor was quite alive the night before. The door cracked open, only his nose and eye visible. "I'm sorry," he said. "Im sorry." The blue door clicked shut, unapologetically. The dead bolt slid in with a finality I did not at the time recognize. I left and had a bacon cheeseburger without him, irritated by his uncharacteristic rudeness.</p><p>What could I have said to him? Should I have forced open the door? Slapped him twice across the face and demanded he tell me what was wrong? Days, weeks later, all the fragments still would not click together. The events seemed unreal, confusing. Some nights I'd tiptoe quietly out of bed, cautious not to wake Madison and risk igniting her anger; I'd sit on the couch, deep in thought until the sky turned lilac. Both suicide and murder seemed like two sides of the same prime-time seduction. In retrospect, this was healthy for me to feel. Cliches remind and reassure us that we're not alone, that others have trod this ground long ago. Still, I could not understand why the world chose to take the easy way out: to write him off simply, then go home to watch TV shows with complicated plots. Maybe that's the habit of our age.</p><p>Then, at four weeks after Crispin's death, I was telephoned by his sister (her voice as thin and pale as a piece of string) and asked to divest his life's possessions; I entered his musty apartment as if it were a crypt.</p><p>At four months, I found myself unable to sleep at night; I'd sit and listen to Madison's breathing, thinking, for some reason, of the parents I never got to know, and how I missed Crispin, with his stupid fedora and strong opinions.</p><p>At six months, I began Crispin's biography; the long hours in the library, the idea that his life could help me with mine, somehow kept me sane.</p><p>At eight months and one week, Madison left me for good; I hoped she'd call but she didn't.</p><p>Late in the night of November 15, 2002, nine months to the day after Crispin's death, I was watching my in box for any e-mail from Madison. With a bing, three new messages appeared. The first was from Baako.Ainsworth@excite.com. It said, in part: "Sharpen your love-sword rubadub soundess. Help that breeds arousal victories. How to last longer making love and have more feelings." The second was from trancejfq22@skaza.wz.cz. It said, in part: "GET DIPLOMA TODAY!If you're looking for a fast way to next level,(non accredited) this is the way out for you."&nbsp;The third e-mail was about to be trashed when I noticed who sent it. The message said, in part: "Dear Sire/Madame . . . I was informed by our lawyer, Clupea Rubra, that my daddy, who at the time was government whistleblower and head of family fortune, called him, Clupea Rubra, and conducted him round his flat and show to him three black cardboard boxes. Along the line, my daddy died mysteriously, and Government has been after us, molesting, policing, and freezing our bank accounts. Your heroic assist is required in replenishing my father's legacy and masticating his despicable murderers. More information TBA." The sender was crispin1037@elsalvador.gob.sv. I brought up a blank message to respond. I wrote: "Crispin?" The cursor winked at me. I hit "send" and waited.</p><p>The next morning, I bought my plane ticket.</p><p>*</p><i><p>See the boy getting on an airplane. He's not a young boy, but a boyish man, as he would describe himself. He sits in his middle seat, notebook open, pen in hand, en route to Manila (I almost wrote "home," he thinks with a smile). It is a trip he hates, both the voyage and arrival. He writes at this moment, "the limbo between outposts of humanity."</p><p>As the airplane is towed backward, he thinks of what he is leaving. Thinks of his lost friend and mentor, seated at the typewriter, working away in a slow accrual of letters, words, sentences, puzzling together pieces shed like bread crumbs on the path behind him.</p><p>The boy will return, heartbroken, lonely, dejected. His three brothers and two sisters are all abroad, free from home--atop a hill in San Francisco, washed under the big Vancouver sky, hidden amid the joyful noise of New York City. His parents, whom he cannot remember, are in graves he cannot bring himself to visit because he knows their bodies are not there. The grandparents, who raised him as best they could, are in Manila, though he no longer has contact with them because of the emotional violence of their last departure. He is coming home, though he doesn't dare admit it. He knows well what empty houses are and the mischief memories can play when cast among unfamiliar echoes.</p></i><p><i>In the long hours spent in the airplane, he tries not to think about how his parents died, and therefore that is all he can think of.

Tries to write the prologue for</i> Eight Lives Lived<i>, the biography he wants to write about his mentor. He fidgets. Thinks. Observes his fellow passengers.

This was of course predicated on the complete intellectual and aesthetic independence of the "I." One eventually realizes such intellectual isolationism promotes style, ego, awards. But not change. You see, I toiled, but saw so little improving around me. What were we sowing? I grew impatient with the social politics that literature could address and alter but had until that time been insufficient in so doing. I decided to actively solicit participation--you know, incite readers to action through my work. I think of the effect of Jose Rizal's books in our own revolution against Spain a century ago. I think of the poetry of Eman Lacaba, who traded his pen for a gun and lived and died in the jungles with the communists in the seventies. "The barefoot army in the wilderness," his famous poem called them. The epigraph of that piece was wonderful. Ho Chi Minh.

On the sheets as she rolled over in the darkness and searched out cool spots that were not there.<br>Murder season.<br>She was floating, drifting. Cruising through an open seam between sleep and consciousness.<br>She glanced at the clock radio but didn&#x2019;t really see it, then fell back into the stream and let go. It was somewhere after midnight, sometime before dawn. Early spring, and the air inside the house was already deadened from the oppressive heat. A steep, lifeless desert wave had swelled over Los Angeles two days ago, pushing the marine layer and the cool breezes out over the ocean where they could be burned up and erased without a witness.<br>The city that was left behind felt dusty and canned in. Vacuum-packed. The air perfumed with spent diesel fuel and gasoline.<br>Murder season would come early this year. It would roll in with the heat like they were best friends. Lovers.<br>She reached across the bed, probing gently for a warm body but finding only emptiness. Only her dreams. A smile worked its way through her body. The one that came with her dreams. She could feel it in her chest and between her legs. She could feel it spreading across her face and blistering through her skin before it rose up and faded away.<br>She had spent the night on the terrace drinking ice-cold Irish reds with Stan Rhodes and Tito Sanchez. Sanchez had brought over a flank steak, marinating the meat, and working the grill with mesquite the way his grandmother had taught him. After dinner they sat on the stone wall and gazed down the hill, the lights of the city caught in the dust and glowing like cotton balls from downtown all the way across the basin to the Pacific. They laughed and told stories in the eerie light, opened fresh bottles, and talked shop. Rhodes and Sanchez were deep in on a new murder case and had worked the last forty-eight hours straight out. Both detectives needed to regroup and get some sleep. Lena had tomorrow off and could afford to relax, maybe even get buzzed. When they left around ten, she popped open the last bottle of ale, stripped off her clothes, and slipped into the pool.<br>Murder season. Trouble ahead. When the streets get hot, business burns.<br>She rolled onto her back, her mind cutting a jagged path to the surface. She could hear something going on in the house&#x2014;something in the background behind her thoughts. A noise pulsing through the still air. She tried to ignore it, fight it. Tried to pretend that it wasn&#x2019;t real. After a while, she wondered if it wasn&#x2019;t part of her dream, a noise in the darkness breaking up her sleep.<br>Until she finally realized that it was her cell.<br>She opened her eyes and saw the light glowing from her phone. She grabbed it, recognized the caller, and slid open the lock on the touch screen. It was her supervisor, Lt. Frank Barrera, Robbery-Homicide Division. She didn&#x2019;t need to guess what he wanted. She checked the clock and read it this time: 2:54 a.m.<br>Murder season. The train was rolling in.<br>&#x201c;You cool, Lena?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s your day off, so I&#x2019;m asking if everything&#x2019;s cool.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m good. What&#x2019;s up? What&#x2019;s that noise in the background?&#x201d;<br>She turned and looked out the window. Sirens. She could hear them in the distance, and she could hear them over the phone. She made the match&#x2014;Barrera was close. He was in the neighborhood. She tried to look down the hill and thought she could see flashing lights. Something was going on just west of the Capitol Records Building.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re in deep shit, Lena. Real deep shit.&#x201d;<br>His voice broke. Barrera&#x2019;s usual demeanor&#x2014;steady as she goes&#x2014;had become tainted with fear.<br>&#x201c;Tell me what you want me to do,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got two dead bodies in Hollywood. That&#x2019;s all I can say over the phone.&#x201d;<br>His voice cut off like he needed to catch his breath. Most homicides in Los Angeles were handled by investigators at the local level. For a murder to bounce up to RHD, the crime had to involve a high profile victim or be particularly horrific. For a Homicide Special detective to get the call with a crime scene still open, it had to be more than that. Some unlucky combination of the two.<br>Lena switched on the light, feeling the rush of adrenaline eat up whatever alcohol remained in her blood. She still didn&#x2019;t have a partner and wouldn&#x2019;t until the fall.<br>&#x201c;Why me?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Orders from Deputy Chief Ramsey. You&#x2019;ll know why when you get here.&#x201d;<br>Ramsey was one of the few members of the old guard who had survived the department&#x2019;s reorganization. He reported directly to Chief Logan, and had become his trusted right hand. His fixer. She knew that Chief Logan had left the city on a ten-day recruiting tour for the Scientific Investigation Division. With the success of the CSI franchise on television, the line of students wanting to become the real thing was a long one. Logan was offering better than decent money and the chance to move to L.A. He knew that he would have his pick of the best and brightest. He also knew that SID had taken a big hit recently and the division needed the fire that came with new blood.<br>&#x201c;Where?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;You ever hear of a place in Hollywood called Club 3 AM?&#x201d;<br>Lena glanced at her .45 on the night table as Barrera gave her the address. She didn&#x2019;t bother writing it down. Everyone in L.A. knew about Club 3 AM. It had become a celebrity hangout.

With easy-to-understand explanations, clear illustrations, and straightforward treatment alternatives, previously unexplained signs and symptoms can be researched, understood and dealt with. Tried-and-true techniques developed over hundreds of years--diet, acupressure, massage, exercise, scraping, and tapping--are offered for common maladies from colds and high blood pressure to backache and depression. Even with limited medical knowledge you can learn to assess your own conditions and become proactive in lifestyle changes, thus taking charge of your own healing process.</p><p>Clive Witham is a licensed acupuncturist and runs an acupuncture clinic in a Spanish enclave in North Africa where he promotes Oriental ideas of healing and self-treatment. He has trained in the UK, China, Thailand and Japan, and is also a Member of the British Acupuncture Council.OF INTEREST Practitioners of Oriental medicine believe that when there is balance in the human body between Yin and Yang the person will exhibit good health however, when Yin and Yang are imbalanced, ill-health occurs. Health is an expression of balance, in Oriental Medicine disease is viewed as a physical expression of an imbalance within the body. Oriental Medicine practitioners look at the symptoms. along with other diagnostic methods, to identify patterns of disharmony. Each of the body organ systems must be in balance within itself and with the other organ systems. Whilst this may appear to be complex it is actually incredibly simple -- balance in the human body. This is why a combination of diet, acupressure, massage, tapping and exercise are effective. Oriental Medicine determines your level of health through the examination of the normal and abnormal organ system functions in your body and, by treating the cause of the problem rather than the symptoms, brings the body back to the point of balance and wellbeing.</p><h2>The Quakers in America (Columbia Contemporary American Religion Series)</h2><p>The Quakers in America is a multifaceted history of the Religious Society of Friends and a fascinating study of its culture and controversies today. Lively vignettes of Conservative, Evangelical, Friends General Conference, and Friends United meetings illuminate basic Quaker theology and reflect the group's diversity while also highlighting the fundamental unity within the religion. Quaker culture encompasses a rich tradition of practice even as believers continue to debate whether Quakerism is necessarily Christian, where religious authority should reside, how one transmits faith to children, and how gender and sexuality shape religious belief and behavior. Praised for its rich insight and wide-ranging perspective, The Quakers in America is a penetrating account of an influential, vibrant, and often misunderstood religious sect.<br> Known best for their long-standing commitment to social activism, pacifism, fair treatment for Native Americans, and equality for women, the Quakers have influenced American thought and society far out of proportion to their relatively small numbers. Whether in the foreign policy arena (the American Friends Service Committee), in education (the Friends schools), or in the arts (prominent Quakers profiled in this book include James Turrell, Bonnie Raitt, and James Michener), Quakers have left a lasting imprint on American life. This multifaceted book is a concise history of the Religious Society of Friends; an introduction to its beliefs and practices; and a vivid picture of the culture and controversies of the Friends today. <br><br>The book opens with lively vignettes of Conservative, Evangelical, Friends General Conference, and Friends United meetings that illuminate basic Quaker concepts and theology and reflect the group's diversity in the wake of the sectarian splintering of the nineteenth century. Yet the book also examines commonalities among American Friends that demonstrate a fundamental unity within the religion: their commitments to worship, the ministry of all believers, decision making based on seeking spiritual consensus rather than voting, a simple lifestyle, and education. Thomas Hamm shows that Quaker culture encompasses a rich tradition of practice even as believers continue to debate a number of central questions: Is Quakerism necessarily Christian? Where should religious authority reside? Is the self sacred? How does one transmit faith to children? How do gender and sexuality shape religious belief and behavior? Hamm's analysis of these debates reveals a vital religion that prizes both unity and diversity.</p><p>Thomas D.

Stewart's newsbreaking investigation of our era's most high-profile perjurers, revealing the alarming extent of this national epidemic. </b><br><br> Our system of justice rests on a simple proposition: that witnesses will raise their hands and tell the truth. In <i>Tangled Webs</i>, James B. Stewart reveals in vivid detail the consequences of the perjury epidemic that has swept our country, undermining the very foundation of our courts.<br><br> With many prosecutors, investigators, and participants speaking for the first time, <i>Tangled Webs</i> goes behind the scene of the trials of media and homemaking entrepreneur Martha Stewart; top White House political adviser Lewis "Scooter" Libby; home-run king Barry Bonds; and Wall Street money manager Bernard Madoff.<br><br> The saga of Martha Stewart's conviction captured the nation, but until now no one has answered the most basic question: Why would Stewart risk prison, put her entire empire in jeopardy, and lie repeatedly to government investigators to save a few hundred thousand dollars in stock gains? Moreover, how exactly was the notoriously meticulous Stewart brought down?<br><br> Drawing on the accounts of then-deputy attorney general James Comey and U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald, Stewart sheds new light on the Libby investigation, making clear how far into the White House the Valerie Plame CIA scandal extended, and why Libby took the fall.<br><br> In San Francisco, Giants home-run king Barry Bonds faces trial due to his testimony before a grand jury investigating the use of illegal steroids in sports. Bonds was warned explicitly that the only crime he faced was perjury. Stewart unlocks the story behind the mounting evidence that he nonetheless lied under oath.<br><br> Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme is infamous, but less well known is how he eluded detection for so long in the face of repeated investigations. Of the four he is the only one who has admitted to lying.<br><br> The perjury outbreak is symptomatic of a broader breakdown of ethics in American life. It isn't just the judicial system that relies on an honor code: Academia, business, medicine, and government all depend on it. <i>Tangled Webs</i> explores the age-old tensions between greed and justice, self-interest and public interest, loyalty and duty. At a time when Americans seem hungry for moral leadership and clarity, <i>Tangled Webs</i> reaffirms the importance of truth.<br><br></p><p><b>James B.

The trilogy earned author Conrad Richter immense acclaim, ranking him with the greatest of American mid-century novelists. It includes <i>The Trees</i> (1940), <i>The Fields</i> (1946), and <i>The Town</i> (1950) and follows the varied fortunes of Sayward Luckett and her family in southeastern Ohio.<br> The Town, the longest novel of the trilogy, won the 1951 Pulitzer Prize and received excellent reviews across the country. It tells how Sayward completes her mission and lives to see the transition of her family and her friends, American pioneers, from the ways of wilderness to the ways of civilization. Here is the tumultuous story of how the Lucketts grow to face the turmoil of the first half of the 19th century. The Town is a much bigger book than either of its predecessors, and with them comprises a great American epic.</p><p>Before becoming one of America&#x2019;s greatest novelists, <b>Conrad Richter</b> (1890&#x2013;1968) worked driving a wagon over the mountains of Pennsylvania, in a machine shop, in a small-town bank, on a farm, in his own timber business, and reporting for newspapers, among other jobs.

They talk and act like real people and while here and there, one encounters a crazy one or a criminal, these exist not as specimens for a psychiatrist crowding at the whole of a scene to the exclusion of all else, but as your neighbors and mine in any ordinary American community. Not one of these characters is dull, for the author has that power of good novelists which finds interest in everything, so that he is able to make even the bore an illuminating study of boredom." &#x2014;Louis Bromfield,&nbsp;<i>New York Herald Tribune Book Review</i><br><br> "There are scenes of sorrow, humor, and excitement; but overshadowing everything like a tall tree in a meadow is Sayward herself. . . . When we leave her, revered and respected by the town, but dying within sound of the new-fangled trains, . . . we feel a personal loss. . . . She might almost stand for a symbol of the pioneer woman.

She collects words, stores them up as a way of fending off the hard truths of her life, the truths that she can't write down in stories.<br>The fresh pain of her mother's death. The burden of raising her sisters while her father struggles over his brokeback farm. The mad welter of feelings Mattie has for handsome but dull Royal Loomis, who says he wants to marry her. And the secret dreams that keep her going--visions of finishing high school, going to college in New York City, becoming a writer.<br>Yet when the drowned body of a young woman turns up at the hotel where Mattie works, all her words are useless. But in the dead woman's letters, Mattie again finds her voice, and a determination to live her own life.<br>Set in 1906 against the backdrop of the murder that inspired Theodore Dreiser's <i>An American Tragedy,</i> this coming-of-age novel effortlessly weaves romance, history, and a murder mystery into something moving, and real, and wholly original.<br></p><p>It's 1906 and 16-year-old Mattie Gokey is at a crossroads in her life. She's escaped the overwhelming responsibilities of helping to run her father's brokedown farm in exchange for a paid summer job as a serving girl at a fancy hotel in the Adirondacks. She's saving as much of her salary as she can, but she's having trouble deciding how she's going to use the money at the end of the summer. Mattie's gift is for writing and she's been accepted to Barnard College in New York City, but she's held back by her sense of responsibility to her family--and by her budding romance with handsome-but-dull Royal Loomis. Royal awakens feelings in Mattie that she doesn't want to ignore, but she can't deny her passion for words and her desire to write. <p> At the hotel, Mattie gets caught up in the disappearance of a young couple who had gone out together in a rowboat. Mattie spoke with the young woman, Grace Brown, just before the fateful boating trip, when Grace gave her a packet of love letters and asked her to burn them. When Grace is found drowned, Mattie reads the letters and finds that she holds the key to unraveling the girl's death and her beau's mysterious disappearance. Grace Brown's story is a true one (it's the same story told in Theodore Dreiser's <i>An American Tragedy</i> and in the film adaptation, <i>A Place in the Sun</i>), and author Jennifer Donnelly masterfully interweaves the real-life story with Mattie's, making her seem even more real. </p><p> Mattie's frank voice reveals much about poverty, racism, and feminism at the turn of the twentieth century. She witnesses illness and death at a range far closer than most teens do today, and she's there when her best friend Minnie gives birth to twins. Mattie describes Minnie's harrowing labor with gut-wrenching clarity, and a visit with Minnie and the twins a few weeks later dispels any romance from the reality of young motherhood (and marriage). Overall, readers will get a taste of how bitter--and how sweet--ordinary life in the early 1900s could be. Despite the wide variety of troubles Mattie describes, the book never feels melodramatic, just heartbreakingly real.

In eleven original essays, contributors explore the extraordinary scope of these aesthetic and social documents and chart a previously undiscovered territory: documentaries that examine the aesthetic, economic, historical, political, and social forces that shape the lives of black Americans, as seen from their perspectives.</p><p>Until now, scholars and critics have concentrated on black fiction film and on mainstream non-fiction films, neglecting the groundbreaking body of black non-fiction productions that offer privileged views of American life. Yet, these rich and varied works in film, video, and new electronic media, convey vast stores of knowledge and experience. Although most documentary cannot hope to match fiction film&#x2019;s mass appeal, it is unrivaled in its ability to portray searing, indelible impressions of black life, including concrete views of significant events and moving portraits of charismatic individuals. Documentary footage brings audiences the moments when civil rights protestors were attacked by state troopers; it provides the sights and sounds of Malcom X delivering an electrifying speech, Betty Carter performing a heart-wrenching song, and Langston Hughes strolling on a beach. </p><p>Uniting all of this work is the "struggle for representation" that characterizes each film&#x2013;an urgent desire to convey black life in ways that counter the uninformed and often distorted representations of mass media film and television productions. African American documentaries have long been associated with struggles for social and political empowerment; for many film/videomakers, documentary is a compelling mode with which to present an alternative, more authentic narrative of black experiences and an effective critique of mainstream discourse. Thus, many socially and politically committed film/videomakers view documentary as a tool with which to interrogate and reinvent history; their works fill gaps, correct errors, and expose distortions in order to provide counter-narratives of African American experience.</p><p>Contributors include Paul Arthur, Houston A.

In this book, scientist and poet Gerald Callahan reveals what science has uncovered, sometimes unwittingly, about us-where we begin, how we grow, why we die, and what comes afterward. An immunologist, Callahan dissects the immune system to reveal its most intimate underpinnings-the selves hidden inside our thymuses, the pieces of others lodged in our lymph nodes, the gift of human death, and the fires that burn inside our bodies. From the seemingly sterile voice of science come the words that define each of us. <br><br>We are singular men and women only because we have immune systems. When immune systems fail, people disappear, and in their places arise communities of living things. Buried inside our genes and our lymphocytes science has found faith and love, madness, and the fierceness of human beings. <br><br>In <i>Faith, Madness, and Spontaneous Human Combustion</i>, Callahan uses research and personal anecdotes to examine these complex issues, proving ultimately that rigorous scientific facts can be intensely intimate.<br><br></p><p><br><b>Gerald N. Callahan, Ph.D.</b>, is an associate professor of immunology at Colorado State University. He is also a poet and essayist<br><br>Combining science and personal anecdote is no easy task, and Callahan's ambitious look at the relationship between immunology and selfhood falls somewhat short of the mark. Callahan a poet, essayist and Colorado State University professor of immunology aims to show how the immune system literally and metaphorically forms the basis for our identity. Weaving together bits of memoir, case studies of unusual incidents like human combustion and virally transmitted insanity, and basic explanations of immunology, Callahan shows how the immune system's main function to distinguish between self and nonself, to defend the body from invaders not only determines the boundaries of the basic biological "self" but can metaphorically be applied to our psychological selves as well. Discussing the concept of immunological memory, for instance, Callahan writes, "Enveloped viruses... are so named because they carry with them an `envelope' of lipids and proteins taken from the host cell.... Each time we give the flu to our wives or our cold sores to our husbands, we also give them a little bit of ourselves." These metaphors unfortunately tend to be simplistic and pat. Those reading the book for straightforward scientific information or Oliver Sacks-style medical curiosities will probably be frustrated by the impressionistic prose and meandering narrative. While there are fascinating facts here, as well as some genuinely engaging recollections from Callahan's life, these are interspersed with self-indulgent whimsy. An unusual attempt at genre crossing, the book would have been better off as a traditional memoir without the popular science conceit. (Jan.)Forecast: Callahan is being marketed as a successor to Oliver Sacks, but he lacks Sacks's gift for engaging narrative. Not a comfortable fit in any category and unlikely to be a crossover hit.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Jungle Book (Oxford Children&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Mowgli is found in the jungle by wolves who bring him up as one of their own.

Their home is a stretch of rocky shore governed by the feral ocean, by a relentless pendulum of abundance and murderous scarcity. Still children with only the barest notion of the outside world, they have nothing but the family's boat and the little knowledge passed on haphazardly by their mother and father to keep them. <p></p>As they fight for their own survival through years of meagre catches and storms and ravaging illness, it is their fierce loyalty to each other that motivates and sustains them. But as seasons pass and they wade deeper into the mystery of their own natures, even that loyalty will be tested. <p></p>This novel is richly imagined and compulsively readable, a riveting story of hardship and survival, and an unflinching exploration of the bond between brother and sister.

A wonderfully provocative and insightful book." <b>--</b>Kevin Powers, author of <i>Yellow Birds </i>and <i>A Shout in the Ruins</i> <p></p>"Few novels have cast their spell on me as deeply as <i>The Innocents</i>. I am reminded of Dickens, not just the nineteenth-century setting and the imperiled children, but the artfulness: brilliant plot, unforgettable minor characters, perfect pacing. Yet Michael Crummey's poetic voice and landscape are his own. <i>The Innocents</i> is brilliant." --Ron Rash, author of <i>Serena</i> <p></p><b>Praise for Michael Crummey</b> <p></p>"Michael Crummey is without a doubt one of Canada's finest writers." --<i>The Globe and Mail</i> <p></p>"Crummey is a poet and a storyteller and he has an extraordinary way of pinning down even a squirming reader and charming them into submission. He's wise in that old soul way. He explores human nature, charting the moral choices of his characters without passing judgement. . . . Crummey's gift is to write with compassion, imbuing the relationships with complexity and depth. He doesn't make anything simple<b>--</b>or simplistic." --<i>National Post</i> <p></p>"It's a rare writer who can fashion a vivid memorial to an all-but-vanished way of life; it's a rarer one who can excavate the vernacular and raise it to planes so poignantly and viscerally true, the exquisite beauty of the apparently ordinary shimmers with a matter-of-fact clarity guaranteed to curl your toes." --<i>Toronto Star</i> <p></p>"Crummey's craftsmanship is masterful." --<i>Maclean's<br></i><br>"Crummey's elegant prose and storytelling prowess make abundantly clear [that] no man is an island." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <p></p>"Crummey's poetics are like the landscape he describes: stark and sparse, but punctuated with a wild richness that creates the impression of something carefully controlled yet on the verge of bursting. . . . In Crummey's capable hands, the setting breeds magic, and the individuals that populate its rugged terrain are nuanced and real." --<i>The Walrus</i></p><h2>Racing Demon: A Play</h2><p><p>In conflict with government, torn with internal dissension on matters of doctrine and practice, the Church of England finds itself enjoying unwelcome publicity.

All that&#x2019;s required is that we learn to let go of our expectation that life should go according the agenda we have in mind. Zen teacher Ezra Bayda provides the teachings and practices we need to learn to let go into true happiness&#x2014;the kind that goes far deeper than the kind that&#x2019;s about getting what we think we want. <br><br>Most of our unhappiness, he explains, is the result of seeking satisfaction in things external to us: new jobs, better relationships, luxury vacations. By liberating ourselves from expectations about these outward things and looking inward instead, we can find a deeper and unshakable kind of satisfaction that not only makes things a lot more pleasant for us, but that generates in us generosity and compassion toward others.&nbsp; <br><br> <i>Beyond Happiness</i> includes simple meditation and mindfulness practices you can use to access true happiness, including basic sitting meditation, gratitude practice, loving-kindness practice, and the Three Questions practice, in which we ask ourselves: <i>Am I happy now? What blocks happiness?</i> and <i>Can I surrender to what is? </i> <i> </i></p><p>Ezra Bayda teaches at Zen Center San Diego.

Ezra Bayda details simple yet powerful methods both to work with mental and emotional obstacles and to cultivate well-being, and it&#x2019;s clear that his hard-won insights grow out of his own dedicated inquiry and practice. Highly recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;John Welwood, author of <i>Toward a Psychology of Awakening</i> <br><br>&#x201c;Bayda&#x2019;s writing is straightforward and his wisdom hard-earned. When he tells us that he himself was &#x2018;born with a fairly low set point for happiness,&#x2019; you get the feeling that Bayda understands what it is that gets people stuck and, having learned a few things himself over years of practice, that his only agenda for <i>Beyond Happiness</i> is to help people find their own way. Fortunately for readers, he&#x2019;s a trustworthy guide.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Tricycle Magazine</i> <br> <br>&#x201c;Bayda&#x2019;s deep understanding of his topic allows him to keep a conversational tone and tie his wisdom into everyday practices.

Soon it becomes increasingly clear that someone wants the new Earl of Stanyon <em>dead</em>....<br><br></p><p>The late Georgette Heyer was a very private woman. Her novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.<br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction. Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.<br><br>In the guide-books it figured as Stanyon Castle; on the tongues of the villagers, it was the Castle; the Polite World spoke of it as Stanyon, as it spoke of Woburn, and of Cheveley It was situated in Lincolnshire, not very many miles from Grantham, rather nearer to Stamford: a locality considered by those who were more interested in the chase than in any particular grandeur of scenery to be admirable. It had more claim to be called a Castle than many another nobleman's seat. A mediaeval fortress, of which various not very interesting records were to be found in the muniment room, now used by Mr. Theodore Frant as an office, had previously stood upon the site; and such portions of the ancient building as had survived the passage of time had been incorporated into the Tudor manor which had succeeded the fortress. Later generations had enlarged and beautified the structure much as their fancies dictated, any difficulty of adding to the mansion being overcome by the designing of another court. The Frant who survived friendship with Bluff King Hal scandalized his generation by the lavish use of oak for wainscoting; his grandson, having enjoyed the advantages of travel, built a new wing, and embellished the old with gildings and painted ceilings; a later Frant, succumbing to the prevailing fashion, ran riot in the rococo style, created the Fountain Court, and was prevented only by death from attempting something of a still more grandiose conception; his heir, one of Mr. Walpole's more fervid adherents, reverted to the Gothick, and by the time an unlucky fall at a regular stitcher, when out with the Old Club, put a period to his career, nowhere in England could have been found such massive doors of oak, such ponderous iron latches, so many pointed, narrow windows, as at Stanyon.<br><br>The sixth Earl of St. Erth, possibly thinking that his principal seat already sprawled over too much ground, more probably prevented from adding a wing in the Palladian style by the straitened times in which he had the ill-fortune to live, contented himself with rebuilding the stables, papering a great many of the rooms, and installing a closed-stove in the enormous kitchen. This was declared by an embittered valet to be the only sign of modern civilization in the entire pile; but the head-cook, mistrusting modernity, allowed it to be used merely for the boiling of vegetables by one of his underlings, while he himself continued to preside over his furnace, with its antiquated ovens, its huge spits, and its iron cauldrons. Unaccustomed guests, wandering distractedly down ill-lit galleries, discovering stairs that led only to uncharted domestic regions, and arriving, flustered and exhausted, where they had been for long attended, had been known to express astonishment that anyone should choose to live in such a rabbit-warren when he owned two other and more convenient country residences. Neither of these, it was true, could boast of Great Halls, Minstrels' Galleries, Armouries, Towers, or Moats: on the other hand, no draughts whistled down their passages; no creeping chill arose from damp walls; and their chimneys very rarely smoked.<br><br>Neither the sixth Earl nor his second wife perceived anything amiss with Stanyon: the Earl because it was the home of his childhood, his lady because she had been bred in an even more inconvenient mansion in the bleak north, and would, in any event, have unhesitatingly bartered comfort for pomp, had she been offered a choice in the matter. The Earl's first wife had hated Stanyon. But the Earl's first wife, though admittedly a lady of birth and quite remarkable beauty, had proved herself to have been quite unworthy of the high position she was called upon to fill. Before her son was out of leading-strings, she ran away with a notorious rake. Her lord, cuckolded, betrayed, and turned into a laughing-stock, expunged her name from the family records, permitted no mention of her to be made within his walls, and scarcely thought himself avenged when he learned that she had died, three years after her flight, in conditions of distress and hardship. His steward and his housekeeper, both persons of sentiment, hoped that upon his death-bed he would remember her, and speak of her with a forgiving tongue, for it seemed to them incredible that so gentle and lovely a lady should hold no place in his heart or memory. They even indulged their fancies by supposing that his overt dislike of his elder son was caused by the secret pangs the sight of the fair boy, who was indeed the image of his mother, caused him to feel. But if the Reverend Felix Clowne, my lord's Chaplain, was to be believed, the Earl's last coherent speech, forcibly phrased if feebly uttered, was a complaint that the wine he had commanded his valet to bring to his room was corked. He had earlier bestowed his blessing upon Martin, his younger son; he had had a kind word for Theodore, his nephew; he had taken punctilious leave of his lady; he had sent proper messages to his married daughter; but the names of his first wife and of his heir had not passed his lips. Nor had his heir arrived at Stanyon to attend his death-bed, although it was certain that Mr. Theodore Frant had sent a letter express to him in Flanders, warning him that his father's demise was imminent. Captain Viscount Des-borough, as he then was styled, was at Mons, with his regiment, and it was conceivable that a high sense of his military duties had prevented him from applying for furlough at a moment when Napoleon was almost hourly expected to cross the frontier. But the seventh Earl, surviving a minor, but rather bloody, engagement at the village of Genappe, and a major engagement at Waterloo, still showed no disposition to return to the home of his ancestors. He sold out, but he remained on the Continent, reposing the fullest confidence in his cousin's ability to administer his estates. Not until twelve calendar months had passed since his father's death did his cousin, and the Dowager Countess, receive tidings from him that he was in England, and about to take possession of his inheritance. He wrote a very civil letter to his mother-in-law, informing her of the proposed date of his arrival at Stanyon, and enquiring in the politest way after her health, and the healths of his half-brother and sister. It was a very pretty letter, the Dowager allowed, but, she added, in unhopeful accents, his mother had had just such caressing ways, and had shown herself to be a Snake in the Bosom.<br><br>"I should perhaps warn you, ma'am, that my cousin will not relish animadversions upon the character of his mother," said Mr. Theodore Frant, a little tight-lipped. "In his presence, such remarks should be spared."<br><br>"My dear Theo," responded the Dowager, "it would be odd indeed if I were to be obliged to consult you on the observances of civility!" He bowed, and, because she cherished no ill-will towards him, she said graciously: "Or anyone else, I am sure! In <em>this </em>house, Desborough&#x2014;or, as I must learn to call him, St. Erth&#x2014; may be sure of every attention called for by his consequence."<br><br>"Just so, ma'am," Mr. Frant said, bowing again.<br><br>"Providence has decreed that he should succeed to his dear father's honours," pronounced the Dowager, thinking poorly of Providence. "One might have supposed that military service in the Peninsula&#x2014;a very unhealthy locality, I understand, setting aside the chances of Violent Death in an engagement, which cannot be altogether precluded&#x2014;might have rendered the present occasion unnecessary. But it was not to be! Had my advice been sought, I should have considered myself bound to state that a military career, for one whom I should have had no hesitation in declaring to be far from robust, could be little short of Fatal! That, my dear Theo, I must have said, for, whatever must be my maternal feelings, if there be <em>one </em>thing upon which I pride myself it is my observance of my duty as a Christian! Happily, as it then seemed (though, according to the workings of an inscrutable fate, it now appears to be a circumstance of little moment), my advice was <em>not </em>sought. Since Lady Penistone chose to interest herself so particularly in her grandson, and my dear husband saw nothing objectionable in the connection, it was not for me to raise my voice. On her head, I said at the time, be the outcome! No doubt her ladyship is a good enough sort of a woman in her way: I do her the justice to acknowledge that she did <em>not, </em>as one might have feared she would, from the incurable levity of her behaviour, condone her unhappy daughter's misconduct: but if she petted and indulged Desbor-ough from any other motive than a malicious desire to tease my poor husband I shall own myself astonished! A spiritless boy, I always thought him, with too much reserve to be pleasing. His career at Eton, you know, was quite undistinguished: a very odd sort of a soldier he must have been!"<br><br>"It is some years since you have seen my cousin, ma'am," Mr. Frant interposed in a measured tone.<br><br>"I hope," said the Dowager, "I am not to be blamed for that! If Lady Penistone chose to invite the boy to stay with her during his school-vacations, and my lord to acquiesce in the arrangement, I take heaven to witness that it was by no expressed wish of mine that Desborough ceased to regard Stanyon as his natural home! On every head my conscience is easy: while he was a child I did my duty towards him; and I am determined now that as no word of censure for his conduct in absenting himself from a beloved parent's obsequies shall be permitted to pass my lips, so also no mark of the respect due to the Head of the Family shall be unobserved. I shall receive him in the Hall."<br><br>This momentous decision being faithfully adhered to, a chilly afternoon in spring saw five persons assembled in what had once been the Great Hall of the Castle. The artistic energies of several generations had largely obliterated most of its original features, but the hammer-beams in its lofty roof remained, and a vast fireplace, made to accommodate the better part of several tree-trunks. The carved screens, having been discovered to have become worm-eaten, had been removed in a previous age, the apartment being thrown open to the vestibule, or entrance-hall, situated at right-angles to it. From this smaller apartment the Grand Staircase, erected in the latter half of the seventeenth century on a scale designed to allow some dozen persons to walk up it abreast, rose in one imposing flight to a broad half-landing, whence it branched to right and left, thus attaining the main gallery of the Castle. Several massive doors strengthened by applied iron-straps, besides the great front-door opposite to the staircase, opened on to the vestibule, a circumstance which added nothing to the comfort of the Hall, in itself a passage to a series of saloons beyond it. The heat thrown out by the logs burning in the fireplace was considerable, but was unavailing to prevent the draughts sweeping through the room. These seemed to come from all quarters, even the heavy curtains which had been drawn across the windows composing almost the entire long wall opposite the fireplace being continually stirred by them. It was dusk, and candles had been lit in the sconces as well as in the several candelabra which stood on the various tables. The little tongues of flame flickered continually, causing the wax to melt unevenly, and making it impossible for one of the persons assembled in the Hall to set the stitches in her embroidery with any degree of accuracy. Having twice changed her seat to no purpose, she folded the work, and replaced it in a tapestry-bag, drawing forth, in its stead, a prosaic piece of knitting, with which she proceeded to occupy herself, in the manner of one prepared to make the best, without comment, of adverse conditions.<br><br>The furnishing of the Hall might have been taken as an example of the heterogeneous nature of the whole Castle, few of the pieces which it contained having been chosen with any nicety of judgement. A fine refectory table, pushed under the windows, and several carved oak chairs with wooden seats, were the only objects which bore any particular relation to their surroundings, the rest of the furniture consisting of pieces representative of every age and style, and including a modern and very ugly side-table, with a marble top, supported by brazen gryphons' heads. Two suits of armour of the surcoatless period guarded the entrance, and several shields, pikes, halberds, and gisarmes were arranged upon the wall above the high plaster mantel-piece. These were flanked by a full-length portrait of the late Earl, leaning negligently with one leg crossed over the other, against the shoulder of his horse; and a fine Battle-piece, of which the most noticeable features were the arresting figure of the commanding officer in the foreground, and the smoke issuing in woolly balls from the mouths of innumerable cannons.<br><br>Only one of the five persons gathered round the fireplace in expectation of the Earl's arrival seemed to be conscious of the discomfort of her situation, and she made no complaint, merely shifting her chair so that the leaping flames should not scorch her face, and pinning her shawl securely across her shoulders to protect them from the cold blast from the vestibule. The Dowager Countess, regally enthroned in a wing-chair, with her feet upon a stool, was indifferent to draughts; neither her son, Martin, moodily standing before the fire, and kicking at a smouldering log, nor Mr. Theodore Frant, engaged in snuffing a candle in the branch set in the centre of the refectory table, was aware of any unusual chilliness; and the Chaplain, seated at her ladyship's left hand, had long since become inured to the Spartan conditions prevailing at Stanyon, and had pronounced the gathering to be very snugly placed. This tribute earned him a gracious smile from the Dowager, who said that it had frequently been remarked that few fires gave out so fierce a heat as this one. She then desired Miss Morville, in a voice of mingled civility and condescension, to be so good as to run up to the Crimson Saloon, and to fetch from it a little hand-screen. Miss Morville at once laid aside her knitting, and departed on her errand; and, as though her absence released him from constraint, Martin looked up from his scowling scrutiny of the fire, and exclaimed: "This is a curst business! I wish it were well over! Why must we kick our heels here, waiting on <em>his </em>pleasure? The lord knows we don't want him! I have a very good mind to ride over to eat my mutton with Barny!"<br><br></p><h2>Jewish Cookery Book</h2><p>When it was first published in 1871, this book offered practical advice for American-born Jews who did not have the benefit of a good Jewish education.

On occasion, Ikkyu played Robin Hood, taking money given by the rich and spending it on the homeless. Interspersing his travels with retreats deep in the mountains, he eventually became head abbot at the most important Zen temple in Japan. Much of his verse rants against the pervasive hypocrisy of the Buddhist establishment and the corruption of the imperial court, but his writing is at its finest when centering around what he loved most: the unfettered Zen life and the joys of sexual intimacy.</p></p><p>Rengetsu (Lotus Moon) was born in Kyoto, Japan in 1791 the illigitimate daughter of a samurai and a young geisha.

The Globe Theatre is delighted to announce a new season of Mr. William Shakespeare&#39;s plays! Prithee take your place once more for a performance of seven of the Bard&#39;s finest tales. See &#34;As You Like It&#34;, &#34;Antony and Cleopatra&#34;, &#34;Richard III&#34;, &#34;Twelfth Night&#34;, &#34;King Lear&#34;, &#34;The Merchant of Venice&#34; and &#34;Much Ado About Nothing&#34; - each brilliantly presented in dramatic comic-strip form, including Mr Shakespeare&#39;s own dialogue and the riotous remarks of the audience. Bravo! Reissued with a new cover look, this brings Marcia Williams&#39; dramatic take on Shakespeare right up-to-date for a modern audience.</p><p>Marcia Williams is a successful author/llustrator and, with her distinctive cartoon-strip style, has now illustrated and retold many literary classics for children, including The Adventures of Robin Hood (9781406311372), Greek Myths (9781406303476) and Oliver Twist and Other Great Dickens Stories (9781406305630). Her latest books are Archie&#39;s War (9781406304275), a child&#39;s diary of the First World War and My Secret War Diary by Flossie Albright (9781406309409), a Second World War journal. Marcia lives in Barnes, London.Grade 3-6-In this appealing follow-up to Tales from Shakespeare (Candlewick, 1998), Williams presents entertaining and accessible retellings of seven more of the Bard's works. Included here are four comedies (As You Like It, Twelfth Night, The Merchant of Venice, and Much Ado About Nothing) and three tragedies (Antony and Cleopatra, Richard III, and King Lear). Each plot is summarized in four to six pages. Comic-book styled cartoon panels, done in pen and watercolor, move the action along. As the actors in the illustrations speak their lines, captions below explain the story in plain English. Meanwhile, stagehands and audience members shown in the border of each spread offer insights and comic relief. "They're mummies, you dummies!" explains a member of the crowd, as Antony and Cleopatra are buried together in a tomb. "Cantankerous harpies!" opines a King Lear attendee, of Cordelia's sisters. The figures in the artwork are not overly attractive. Many of the men are skinny, balding, and sniveling. Heroines are stout and homely, but their strengths still shine through. In this refreshing approach, all looks are equal and the characters can be judged by their deeds and personalities. Shakespeare is a challenge for most folks and this book provides an approachable introduction to his wordy magic.

Despite enough injuries during the pre-race practice to promise a spectacular--and dangerous--race, Undersheriff Estelle Reyes-Guzman has even more pressing concerns on her mind.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Someone has been using Jerry Turner's big Cessna 206 and then returning it to its hangar at the Posadas airport. The most likely explanation is clandestine trips into Mexico, but a State Police drug-sniffing dog finds no evidence of contraband. Estelle has worries at home as well. Facing his first public piano recital, her prodigiously talented seven-year-old son is stubbornly refusing to tell anyone what he plans to play, and it's making everyone, including his music teacher, very nervous.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The day of the big race brings a tragedy that doesn't look like an accident, and as the investigation continues, puzzling connections surface deep in Mexico. Posadas County is now mixed up in something bigger and more sinister than it's ever faced before, and it's up to Estelle to uncover the truth before things spin out of control.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Readers of <i>Final Payment,</i> whether they are encountering Posadas County for the first time or gladly returning, will be charmed by Estelle, her family, and the various citizens of this vibrant community. And never fear! The retired sheriff Bill Gastner is still in town, rounding out the cast of this entertaining, highly readable mystery.</p><p><b>Steven F. Havill</b> is the author of the Sheriff Bill Gastner mysteries, as well as several Westerns. He lives with his wife, Kathleen, in Rat�n, New Mexico.<br>&nbsp;Chapter One <br>Estelle Reyes-Guzman's passenger leaned forward, enormous blue eyes wide with a mixture of apprehension and excitement. <br>"Oh my, isn't this something," County Manager Leona Spears whispered. The "something" was a spot where the U.S. Forest Service's two-track meandered close to the formidable, crumbling rim of Cat Mesa. For a few yards, no trees blocked the panoramic view of Posadas County, from the flat, barren reaches of the eastern prairie to the San Crist�bal Mountains to the south and west. The mountains formed a natural barrier with neighboring Mexico. From this spot, Undersheriff Guzman could see the entire southern half of Posadas County, including the village of Posadas, which nestled on the mesa's flank below them. <br>The road ducked back into the trees again, away from the mesa rim, and almost immediately they saw the flashing lights of the large, boxy EMT rescue unit a hundred yards ahead. The ambulance was parked just off the narrow lane, and Estelle pulled her county SUV to a halt a dozen yards behind it. <br>"And this is only practice," she said. The comment elicited a groan from the county manager. Despite best efforts, they both knew that there was no way to guarantee safety in a hundred-mile bicycle race through the county's roughest backcountry. To the competitors, of course, that was the attraction. <br>In this instance, the emergency came two days before the race itself, during a casual practice ride. <br>Estelle could see activity fifty yards ahead through the trees, and she glanced across at the county manager. Leona, with her frilly white blouse, neatly tailored business suit, and stylish low-heeled shoes, was not dressed for the boonies. As if reading the undersheriff's mind, the large woman waved a hand. "You go ahead. I'll wait." That brought a smile from Estelle, who knew Leona's insatiable curiosity. <br>I'll give you thirty seconds, she thought. <br>Even as she stepped out and closed the door of the Expedition, Estelle could see the bicycle tracks cut in the dirt. How the injured rider had come to drift so far from the marked race route was still a mystery, unless it was the obvious lure of a "shortcut." <br>In a moment, as she emerged through the last clump of oak brush, the undersheriff saw that the unlucky cyclist had already been splinted, bandaged, and IV'd, then strapped to a gurney and hoisted to safety. Now, a dozen feet from the mesa edge, three EMTs worked over their patient, ignoring the spectacular abyss behind them. Estelle slipped the small digital camera out of her pocket and took several photos before approaching any closer. <br>A girl in rainbow-colored spandex, her face pasty white with short red hair plastered to her forehead where her helmet had pressed, sat at the base of a sturdy pi�on while a fourth EMT bandaged the girl's bloody knee. <br>"Hey there, sheriff," the EMT working on the knee said. She had glanced up when she heard the camera. "Not your usual kind of MVA we got this time. What brings you up here?" <br>"My number came up," Estelle replied cheerfully. The injured girl opened her eyes as Estelle knelt beside her. "What happened?" <br>"It was his big idea," the girl said, and gulped air. "He said this trail was a shortcut that no one else knew about." She closed her eyes. <br>"Glad no one else did," EMT Matty Finnegan said sympathetically. She made a diving motion with one hand. "Right over there, Estelle. Looks like he tried to stop when the trail made a turn, but he got crossed up somehow. About a fifteen-foot drop." <br>"Ay," Estelle said. She touched the girl lightly on the arm. "What's your partner's name?" <br>The girl grimaced as the EMT snugged the bandage. "Terry Gutierrez. We're from Socorro. I think that Dumb Butt was looking over his shoulder, to see if I was behind him. Then he didn't have time to stop." <br>"And your name?" <br>"April Pritt," she said, gritting her teeth. "Shit, that hurts." <br>The EMT nodded. "You're a lucky girl, Miss April. Other than the knee," she said to Estelle, "April is okay, sheriff. A nasty laceration. Pretty brave, too. She climbed down over the cliff there to help her friend." <br>"I lost my balance," April said. <br>"You sure did. But no fractures." Matty reached out and gently patted the side of her patient's bandaged knee. "No stitches, if she's lucky." She looked critically at one knee, then the other. "Just another scar to keep all the others company." <br>"How's he?" Estelle turned and watched as one of the EMTs adjusted the huge cervical collar on the injured rider. The young man's eyes were closed, his jaw slack under the oxygen mask. <br>"Not so lucky," Matty said. "But I think he'll be okay. We'll just have to see. I tell you what, though . . . thank God for small favors like cell phones." <br>Stepping so carefully that she appeared to be stalking wild game, the county manager appeared from the oak brush. "Oh my," Leona said, hesitating well back from the mesa edge. The county manager had her own small camera in hand, and Estelle turned to make sure that the enormous woman wasn't planning to step near the rim. <br>"A bad fall," the undersheriff said to her to make sure she had Leona's attention. "Two competitors from Socorro." The girl with the battered knee looked up at Leona apologetically, even though she had no idea who the enormous woman might be. <br>"Oh my," Leona said again. She took a reflexive step back when she saw Estelle walk over and stand near the edge of a large block of limestone. The view of the county was spectacular, but Estelle's attention was drawn to the broken juniper limbs below, and the blood swashes on the gray boulders. It made a grim photograph. <br>As she knelt at the mesa's edge on that warm May afternoon, Estelle leaned forward just enough to trace in her mind's eye the arc of the cyclist's free fall, to imagine the short burst of panic as he realized his mistake. The bicyclist had plunged over the mesa rim, arms flailing and his cry of panic echoing through the canyons. His trajectory ended with a fifteen-foot free flight that smacked into a jumble of jagged boulders capping the long talus slope that formed the mesa's apron. He had hit so hard that his helmet broke open like a coconut shell. The helmet lay next to the mangled bike, and Estelle walked over and picked it up. One deep gash had torn the helmet's brightly colored plastic just above the temple. She grimaced and held it up for Leona to see. <br>"He's lucky," Leona said. <br>"We hope so," Estelle replied. The blood on the helmet indicated otherwise. She placed the shattered helmet carefully on the frame of the bike and turned back to the girl. <br>"You climbed down?" Estelle asked. <br>"Sort of," April said through clenched teeth. "Not the most graceful thing I've ever done. Is he going to be all right?" <br>"I think so," Estelle said. She regarded the spot where the eighteen-year-old girl had stopped her bike shy of disaster. No doubt she had seen her boyfriend below, so battered, broken, and lacerated that all he could do was lie in a growing puddle of blood and whimper. There was no easy route down, and her good judgment had been clouded by panic. "You called us from down there?" <br>"No. I didn't know what to do, so I called 911 first. But then I saw all the blood, and I knew I couldn't wait." <br>"Brave girl," Estelle said. She turned away from the rim. "Just a wrong turn on an unfamiliar shortcut," Estelle said to Leona. "As simple as that. No shortcuts allowed in the actual race." <br>"Mercy, I should hope not. You're not climbing down there, are you?" <br>"No. . . . I don't think I need to." She took another photo, this time zooming in on the blood smear down below as closely as the camera allowed, then zooming back for a panorama. <br>Eleven miles to the southeast, she could see the village of Posadas where the cyclists had set out on their practice ride as they prepared for the race coming up that weekend. The asphalt ribbon of County Road 43 that wound up the foot of the mesa, first passing the landfill and then the abandoned Consolidated Copper Mine, was the easiest portion of the route. After reaching the old quarry, the race route turned first onto steep Forest Service roads for the ascent up Cat Mesa. Beyond that, it was rough two-tracks, footpaths, stream beds, and worse. <br>"The Blood and Broken Bones One Hundred," Estelle said, then pointed. The sudden motion made Leona flinch. "You can see more riders coming up the hill." <br>A handful of specks moved on the paved road, more cyclists taking a final afternoon training ride. No doubt in an hour or so they would stop at this very spot, marveling at their comrade's attempt at unpowered flight. <br>The undersheriff reached out a hand and rested her palm on the sharp limestone. The gray rock was warm, and with one finger she traced the scrape where one of the cyclist's pedal cranks had caught just before he'd launched. <br>"My, oh my," the Posadas County manager whispered, drawing closer to see the scar on the rock. <br>"Don't step too close to the edge," Estelle reminded her again. "Some of the rocks are loose." She could imagine the blond, Heidi-braided Brunhilde taking flight, and it wasn't a pretty sight. <br>"Okay, let's do it," one of the EMTs said, and they picked up the gurney as if the battered and fractured cyclist were weightless. The girl started to get up, but Matty reached out and put a restraining hand on her shoulder. <br>"No, no," she said. "You don't walk. They'll be back in just a minute with your ride. Just kick back and relax." <br>"I think I can make it," the girl said. <br>"I'm sure you can. But you're not going to." &lt;...</p><h2>Little House Farm Days</h2><p>Gentle adaptations of Laura Ingalls Wilder's celebrated Little House stories have been gathered together here in two new titles in our Little House Chapter Book series.Frontier life wasn't always easy, and in Hard Times on the Prairie, Laura and her family struggle against prairie fires, grasshoppers, and winter blizzards.But with their fighting pioneer spirit, the Ingalls family always manages to make it through the hardest of hard times.In Little House Farm Days, Laura has to do her part to help run the Ingalls family farm.

He divides his time between Kolkata and Goa, India, and Brooklyn, New York.An engrossing chronicle of historical detection smoothly integrated into a subtly shaped picture of village life in modern Egypt; by an Indian novelist (The Circle of Reason, 1986) of great sensitivity and power. Enrolled as a cultural-anthropology graduate student at the University of Alexandria, Ghosh settled in 1980 into the Egyptian farming village of Lataifa. Two years earlier, he had become interested in ancient manuscripts found in a storeroom of a tenth- century Cairo synagogue; included in the cache were letters from a Jewish trader, who mentioned his Indian slave. Intrigued, Ghosh pursued the identity of his 12th-century countryman. The author's findings about the daily activities of slave and master make fascinating reading (e.g., that the slave represented his master in financial dealings), and alternating with this historical data are chapters detailing Ghosh's gradual assimilation into the life of Lataifa. His affectionate portraits of the villagers and of their often colorful idiosyncracies (for example, the complicated relationship between the Imam and his estranged first wife) attest to his perceptivity as a sympathetic observer of a rapidly changing society. In a particularly effective passage, he recounts his feelings when, after persistent questioning about his Hindu beliefs, he discovered in himself what he calls ``Indians' terror of symbols.'' And Ghosh is equally astute in detailing the changes wrought by young villagers' departures for jobs in wartime Iraq. While new homes, refrigerators, TVs, and electric generators proliferate, he says, the weakening of family and civic ties proves a high price to pay. Throughout, Ghosh writes with enormous lucidity and flashes of gentle humor, conveying in small and telling details the underlying suspiciousness and insecurity that pervade Egyptian society. Moving in its humanity, revealing in its analyses: an exceptionally satisfying work. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Though the reputation he gained in the wake of his turbulent personal life sometimes overshadows his literary career, he remains a superb storyteller, who perfectly captured the lifestyle and laconic humour of the rugged Kiwi outdoors man. His ability to craft a tale that is both moving and funny is superbly illustrated by the huge international success of the movie Hunt for the Wilderpeople, which is based on his book Wild Pork and Watercress. Almost all of Barry Crump&#39;s books are now out of print. This new volume of Collected Stories remedies that, by presenting five of his great classics in a handsome, hardback edition. The stories are: A Good Keen Man | Bullock Creek | Gold and Greenstone | Wild Pork and Watercress | Puha Road Barry Crump: Collected Stories belongs on the bookshelf of every New Zealand home, an important, highly enjoyable and often hilarious part of our literary heritage.</p><p>BARRY CRUMP was born in 1935 and died in 1996. In 1959 he began writing humorous sketches of life as a government deer-culler and pig hunter, publishing these as A Good Keen Man in 1960. This became a massive bestseller in New Zealand and over the next 50 years he wrote another 23 books, which sold over a million copies. As well as a best-selling author, Crump was an actor, TV personality, poet, radio commentator, man of leisure, traveller, goldminer, photographer and more. A successful 12-year association with Toyota brought a series of award-winning advertisements that catapulted Crump into living rooms around the country with his laconic, blokey style. Crump was married 5 times and had 6 children, all sons. In the 1990s Crump was awarded an MBE and OBE for services to literature, something he was quietly proud of and reckoned they&#39;d be hard case pinned to his Swanndri. He was listed in the Who&#39;s Who as having no fixed abode, and regarded himself as a world citizen.

He holds two Ph.D.&#39;s in education, from Stanford University and from Cornell. He is a professor at Simon Fraser University.This riotous narrative recounts how a middle-aged Irish Canadian transformed a weedy area of his backyard into a peaceful Zen garden, and how he struggled to tame his Western character along the way. Inspired by the miniature garden a friend built on her apartment balcony in Japan, Egan "set out in a rather indirect and rambling way to make a paradise" back home in Vancouver. With wry humor he details his efforts to outwit weeds "of supernatural and malevolent cunning" and to hack through primordial tangles of bindweed using his favorite new tool: the mattock. Reality lags behind dreams as Egan struggles to lay tons of stone, copes with a sagging new fence and conquers his timidity before the "real people" in the gardening business. (He quickly realizes, "It is hard for the middle-class type to get lumberyard chic just right.") Do-it-yourselfers will identity with Egan's anguish as he no sooner clears an area of unwanted vegetation than it creeps back, even stronger, in new spots. Even the water in his pool finds unwanted channels and outlets. Ultimately, however, his Japanese quince lives, the bamboo thrives and the water falls gracefully into the pond rather than thudding down in torrents. Egan admits that a few clever-fingered Japanese experts might have converted his garden far more efficiently than his "ham-fisted" self, but then readers, especially male garden-types, would have been denied the pleasure of this humorous and informative memoir. Many b&amp;w photos mark milestones in the transformation that is a "mixture of Eastern Zen and Western irony."

That is, until he meets the dog trainer. Heather is bright, beautiful...and she just might be the only woman on earth who wants nothing to do with him.&nbsp;<br><br>Heather Linsey can't believe she agreed to train Zach's new pup, especially since his focus seems to be more on winning her heart than training his dog. Having sworn off love, she has vowed never to fall for a charming man. But Heather's determination to push Zach away only fuels his determination to get closer&#x2014;and the sensual and emotional connection between them grows more undeniable. Will the biggest Sullivan bad boy of all tempt Heather into believing in forever again?</p><p><b>Having sold more than 3 million books, Bella Andre's New York Times and USA Today bestselling novels have been #1 bestsellers around the world. Known for "sensual, empowered stories enveloped in heady romance" (Publishers Weekly), her books have been Cosmopolitan Magazine "Red Hot Reads" twice and have been translated into ten languages.</b><br><br>Zach Sullivan stared with disgust at the bundle of fur chewing on his shoelace.<br><br>"No way." He shifted his foot to try to get the little bugger off but, for such a tiny thing, it was tenacious. It growled a little and shook its tail as it renewed focus on his shoe. His new shoe.<br><br>"Sophie loves dogs. Ask her."<br><br>He looked up to see Gabe smirking at him. Clearly, it had been way too long since he'd wiped a grin off his little brother's face.<br><br>"Sophie's got enough to deal with lately, between her pregnancy and marrying Jake," Gabe told him. "Chloe and Chase are going to have their kid any second now. Marcus and Nicola are always on the road. Ryan is practically living at the stadium for baseball season. And I wouldn't trust Lori with a dog if she was the last person on earth. Trust me, you were at the end of my list for someone to watch the puppy while we're away on vacation, but Summer insisted you <em>needed</em> to have Cuddles."<br><br>Zach almost hurled. "Cuddles?"<br><br>"Summer named her." They both looked down at the puppy. "I think the name fits pretty well."<br><br>Gabe was incredibly protective of Summer, his fianc�e Megan's daughter. Zach knew better than to insult the dog's name, even if it was, hands down, the worst one ever.<br><br>"Look," Gabe said, "Summer is convinced you're the perfect person to keep the puppy. For some reason none of us can figure out, she thinks you can do no wrong. Don't disappoint her, Zach."<br><br>Zach had thought Summer was pretty great for a seven-year-old. Until now, when she was trying to stick him with a dog he didn't want for two weeks. Especially since there was no way a puppy was going to fit into his life for even two days.<br><br>His daily&#x2014;and nightly&#x2014;schedule was all about fast cars and pretty women. What the hell was he going to do with a puppy?<br><br>Shaking his head, Zach said, "You've really lost your touch, Gabe, letting two girls lead you around."<br><br>Zach was still surprised by how smitten his brother was&#x2014;not only with Megan, but with her daughter, too. And it wasn't just Gabe who had fallen way down deep in the bottomless pit of "true love." Chase, Marcus and Sophie had tripped into it, too.<br><br>Their mother was beyond thrilled knowing there were babies and more Sullivan weddings on the way. Zach was happy she was happy. Just as long as she had no false expectations about him falling in love.<br><br>Because it was <em>never</em> going to happen.<br><br>But Gabe clearly didn't care if he'd lost his touch, or that he'd never be able to pick up a stranger at a bar for hot sex again. If anything, his brother looked disgustingly happy about it.<br><br>"I'm not asking you to dress the puppy up in frilly doggy clothes or to spend all day rolling around in the grass with her. I just need you to keep her fed and watered and walked while we're on our trip. So, will you do it or do I have to break Summer's heart by telling her she's wrong about you being a good guy?"<br><br>As if to punctuate his brother's request, Cuddles finally let go of her grip on Zach's shoelace and looked up at him with oversize brown eyes, her little pink tongue licking at her whiskers as if she'd just finished a truly tasty meal.<br><br>Damn it, he'd always been a sucker for puppy-dog eyes.<br><br>He wasn't happy about it, but he supposed he could suck it up for a couple of weeks while Gabe, Megan and Summer took a European vacation to see castles and princesses and whatever else it was Summer had been going on and on to him about at the last Sunday lunch.<br><br>His reputation as a player with women was well deserved, and it was exactly how he liked things: no deep connections to have to deal with down the road, no woman to disappoint or leave behind one day. But his family was different. His brothers and sisters meant everything to him.<br><br>"Fine." He scowled down at the dog. "I'll do it. What breed is she, anyway?"<br><br>His brother grinned, not bothering to hide his evil pleasure at Zach's capitulation. "A Yorkshire terrier. Evidently, she's a big one."<br><br>"Big?" He bent and picked her up by the ruff with two fingers before putting her back down by his shoe. "She can't weigh more than a couple of pounds."<br><br>"Closer to three," Gabe said as he headed for Zach's front door and came back a few seconds later with a huge cardboard box. "Here are her things."<br><br>Zach knew what the food and bowls were for, but everything else looked as if it belonged in the toy box at a preschool. "Why does a three-pound puppy need all of this for just two weeks?"<br><br>He had a bad feeling about this whole thing, sensing how easily fourteen days could turn into way longer than that if he wasn't careful.<br><br>Gabe shrugged. "We've only had her a couple of days and Summer has mostly been taking care of her so far. Timing kind of sucks on having to leave her so soon, but I know Megan really appreciates you stepping up to the plate like this."<br><br>It grated that they all thought he would be such a pushover about the puppy before even talking to him about it. But that didn't bother him nearly as much as when Cuddles chose that exact moment to squat down over the toe of his shoe and empty her bladder.<br><br>Her surprisingly large bladder.<br><br>"You'd better be back for her in two weeks," Zach warned in a low voice, "or she's going straight to the pound."<br><br>Gabe's laughter rang out as he wisely hightailed it to his car.<br><br>* * *<br><br>Heather Linsey was just finishing up with the students in her preliminary-level dog trainer certification class when her cell phone buzzed. She pulled it out, but when she saw the name on her screen, she quickly shoved it back into her pocket.<br><br>"I can handle giving everyone the information for the next set of classes if you need to get that," her assistant, Tina, said.<br><br>Heather forced a smile. "That's okay. I've got it."<br><br>But her mind was only half on her students as she wrapped things up and congratulated them on a job well done, letting them know she was available if they had any problems setting up their new businesses. Finishing up with a quick reminder about the big Bark in the Park fundraiser at the baseball stadium that coming Friday, and the silent auction the following Saturday night, she headed back to her office with Atlas, her Great Dane, close beside her.<br><br>Heather closed the door before pulling the phone back out and putting it on her desk. She wished she could just delete the message, but she knew from past experience that it would be smarter to find out what her father wanted.<br><br><em>"Sweetheart, I was hoping I'd get you rather than your voice mail,"</em> he began, and she was amazed at just how strong his denial was. Didn't he realize she hadn't picked up a call from him in years? She rubbed her hands over her arms as he continued. <em>"I have a business trip to San Francisco next week and I'm thinking of bringing your mother with me.</em><br><br><em>It's been too long since we've seen our girl and we both miss you."</em><br><br>The skin on Heather's arms started to tingle, and then burn. The sensation started at her wrists and crept up across the pattern of crisscrossed scars that went past her elbows and all around the back of her arms. Nearly ten years later, the scars were faint enough that she probably didn't need to wear long sleeves all the time. But even though the cuts were long since healed, every time she had to deal with her father, she felt this phantom pain. It was almost as if she were seventeen years old again and locking herself into her room to try to deal with her out-of-control emotions. Back then, the only way she could deal with the anxiety was by making small cuts across the surface of her skin with a razor, and then watching them bleed.<br><br>At the sound of her father's voice, Atlas hadn't gone to his huge dog pillow in the corner. Instead, he'd stuck right with her and put his big head in her lap. She stopped rubbing her arms and stroked his head instead.<br><br><em>"Let me know your schedule so we can plan our evening with you. Your mother sends her love."</em><br><br>The message ended and she stared blankly at the phone on her desk, her hand absentmindedly moving over Atlas's short, soft fur. She couldn't believe how long they'd been playing this game, the one where her father acted as if everything was normal and they had a perfect relationship. Especially when he knew that she <em>knew</em> for a fact that everything wasn't perfect, that his "perfect" marriage to her mother and his "loving" relationship with his daughter was just a big, stupid lie.<br><br>A knock came at her door, jarring her out of her dark thoughts. "Come in."<br><br>Agnes Mackelroy, a pretty middle-aged woman whom Heather liked a great deal, poked her head in the door. "Good morning, Heather. I was hoping you had a few minutes." Despite Heather's smile, the woman seemed to sense something was wrong. "Is everything all right?"<br><br>Heather nodded quickly. "It's always so lovely to see you."<br><br>And it was true&#x2014;she couldn't be happier to see Agnes and her dog, Joey, especially if it meant she didn't have to think about her father anymore.<br><br>Agnes had been one of Heather's first clients at Top Dog when the ink was still drying on her business cards. Over the past few years, she'd given dozens of referrals to Heather to work with her family's and friends' dogs.<br><br>Heather knelt to say hello to Agnes's chow chow. "Look at you with your fancy new knee," she said as she scratched the dog under his chin, right where he loved it. Atlas soon bumped her out of the way to say hello. "I take it he's been doing well since surgery?" she asked Agnes.<br><br>"Just splendidly! He's back to his old self, out digging up my garden morning, noon and night."<br><br>Heather had to laugh at that, even though stopping that behavior was something she'd worked on long and hard with Agnes and Joey last year. "Would you like me to drop by later this week to see if we can get him to celebrate in a different way?"<br><br>"No, I'm perfectly happy to let Joey have his fun. I didn't much care for the color of the begonias, anyway," Agnes said with a toss of her hand. "I'm actually here on behalf of a very good friend with a new puppy."<br><br>"Perfect timing. I've just finished up a group training class and have several new trainers who would love to get their feet wet. Why don't I give you a few of their numbers?"<br><br>"I was hoping," Agnes said, "that you might be available to help him personally."<br><br>Heather's business and dog-training staff had grown so much over the past three years that she spent most of her time managing the business. While she still loved to pop out of her office to play with the dogs that came in and out of her training campus, at this point she rarely took on one-on-one training clients. But she couldn't possibly say no to Agnes, who was responsible for so much of her early success.<br><br>Mentally reshuffling her busy schedule, Heather said, "What's your friend's name?"<br><br>"His name," Agnes said, "is Zach."<br><br>Something akin to a warning skittered down Heather's spine at the woman's almost-worshipful tone. Then again, she knew Agnes was happily married.<br><br>"I know how much he'd appreciate it if you could meet with him this morning at the garage where he works. He's dog-sitting for a couple of weeks, but I'm afraid the little Yorkie is running the poor man in circles."<br><br>Heather wrote down the address for Sullivan Autos, then gave both Agnes and her dog hugs as they said goodbye.<br><br>She couldn't imagine a mechanic's boss being too happy about a madcap puppy running around in an auto shop. Not to mention that it definitely wasn't the safest environment for an untrained dog.<br><br>"Ready to go play with a puppy?" she asked the huge dog lying at her feet.<br><br>Atlas's ears perked up at his favorite word. It had always amused her how much her two-hundred-pound Great Dane loved to play with puppies, even though they tended to nip at him with their sharp little teeth and use their nails to climb onto his broad back with no concern whatsoever for their own welfare.<br><br>She suspected the reason had something to do with the fact that the early part of his life hadn't been all that carefree. Once he became her dog things changed...a lot. Now he thrived on being around rambunctious puppies.<br><br>It was a warm day and Heather gathered her long hair up into a ponytail, then grabbed her training bag and headed to her car. Atlas bounded into the backseat, immediately sticking his head out of the window in anticipation of having the wind in his face, his tongue flying free.<br><br>Ten minutes later, Heather pulled up outside Sullivan Autos and slipped on Atlas's leash. She could see a half dozen men on-site, and even though her dog was worlds better around men than he had been when she'd first taken him home four years ago, she was concerned that so many big men in one place might overwhelm him. She wasn't surprised when he stuck close to her, the stiffness of his ears and tail a telltale sign that he wasn't entirely relaxed.<br><br>"Everything's fine," she soothed him, rubbing gently between his ears. "We're just going to play with a puppy, remember?" His tongue plopped out at that happy news and she grinned in response. "That's right, we've got nothing to worry about at&#x2014;"<br><br><em>"Where the hell is that damned puppy!"</em><br><br></p><h2>The C.S.

This volume contains over 400 full color photos of over 100 different uniforms of the Heer, Kriegsmarine, Luftwaffe, Waffen-SS, Polizei, and foreign volunteers. A special section focuses on the uniforms and equipment of the Fallschirmjager. All of which are hyper-detailed replicas. With &#34;collecting&#34; now such a cut throat business; availability and cost of many items is now beyond the wherewithal of most. But dreams don&#39;t have to stay dreams nowadays with so many replica items available. Using a team approach Soldat FHQ has helped knit together hundreds of dreams into real collections. This volume details part of one such collection. This volume of SOLDAT sets the hobbyist free of the bounds of size and expense to turn a dream into a collection. Like the other SOLDAT XI series books, this volume shows what can be done with replicas so the reader can be forewarned as they venture into shows, both virtual and real, as to what has been and a what can be replicated. I am still shocked at what I see sold by reputable vendors as &#34;100% original&#34; collectibles; and with this volume of SOLDAT one fake spotted pays for the book many times over!

We had always shared a love of home cooking and making memories with family &amp; friends and so, after many a conversation over the backyard fence, <b>Gooseberry Patch</b> was born.<br> <br> We put together our first catalog at our kitchen tables, enlisting the help of our loved ones wherever we could. From that very first mailing, we found an immediate connection with many of our customers and it wasn't long before we began receiving letters, photos and recipes from these new friends. In 1992, we put together our very first cookbook, compiled from hundreds of these recipes and, the rest, as they say, is history.<br> <br> Hard to believe it's been over 25 years since those kitchen-table days! From that original little <b>Gooseberry Patch</b> family, we've grown to include an amazing group of creative folks who love cooking, decorating and creating as much as we do. Today, we're best known for our homestyle, family-friendly cookbooks, now recognized as national bestsellers.<br> <br> One thing's for sure, we couldn't have done it without our friends all across the country. Each year, we're honored to turn thousands of your recipes into our collectible cookbooks. Our hope is that each book captures the stories and heart of all of you who have shared with us. Whether you've been with us since the beginning or are just discovering us, welcome to the <b>Gooseberry Patch</b> family!</p><h2>Cocaine Nights</h2><p>Features a man who finds himself drawn into a network of drugs, pornography, and murder in a Spanish resort</p><p>When travel writer Charles Prentice arrives at Estrella de Mar, a resort town near Gibraltar populated primarily by British retirees, to find out why his brother Frank has been jailed, he's shocked to find that Frank has confessed to a spectacular act of arson that left five people dead. Charles tries to find the real culprit by hanging around Estrella de Mar, which one resident describes as "like Chelsea or Greenwich Village in the 1960s. There are theatre and film clubs, a choral society, cordon blue classes.... Stand still for a moment and you find yourself roped into a revival of <i>Waiting for Godot</i>." But the longer he stays, the more confused Charles is by the residents' breezy lack of concern about the constant background of vandalism, rape, prostitution, and drug dealing.<p> Things become clearer as Charles makes the acquaintance of local tennis pro Bobby Crawford, who has some interesting hypotheses about how to maintain the quality of the inner life in the age of affluence. As another of the locals explains, "Leisure societies lie ahead of us, like those you see on this coast. People ... will retire in their late thirties, with fifty years of idleness in front of them.... But how do you energize people, give them some sense of community?" Bobby's succinct answer, provided to Charles in another context: "There's nothing like a violent reflex now and then to tune up the nervous system." Bobby convinces Charles to help him replicate his social experiment in an adjacent retirement community, slowly convincing him that crime and creativity really do go hand in hand. But who, if anybody, takes the responsibility?</p><p> <i>Cocaine Nights</i> resonates quite neatly with Ballard's earlier science fiction and experimental stories. As early as <i>The Atrocity Exhibition</i>, Ballard was speculating about the salubrious effects of transgression, and his science fiction novel <i>High Rise</i> also deals with the introduction of violence to a self-contained paradise. <i>Cocaine Nights</i> differs from that earlier work primarily in that it is a naturalistic fiction set in a world that is much more ostensibly real, a world that, with a little less detached theorizing (even at his most natural, it seems, Ballard cannot help but be clinical) on the part of its characters, might even be mistaken for real. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>J. G. Ballard&#39;s novels include the acclaimed Empire of the Sun, for which he was awarded the James Tait Black Memorial Prize; Crash, recently adapted for film; and The Crystal World.

Triber is an independent scholar."A fascinating study of the efforts of an ambitious young artisan who ultimately achieved the status of the gentlemen he had long admired and so ardently desired to emulate. This is a significant achievement and enhances our understanding of America's formative years. Any future analysis of Revere will certainly have to begin with Triber's work."&#x2015;<i>American Historical Review<br></i><br><br>"Well written, extensively researched, and extremely detailed. . . . This will, no doubt, be the standard biography for years to come."&#x2015;<i>Virginia Quarterly Review</i><br><br>"Revere will be forever immortalized by the mythology surrounding his 'ride.' The man behind the myth was far more interesting, as this informative and often surprising biography illustrates. . . . Triber is especially effective in describing the hothouse intellectual and social milieu of eighteenth-century Boston, which nurtured republicanism. This work is a worthy addition to any U.S. history collection."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Triber gives us a portrait like John Singleton Copley's famous leather-aproned image: A proud, ambitious master craftsman eager for ever-greater prosperity and social recognition. Early on she proclaims her interest in 'what attracted Paul Revere to the Revolutionary cause, how [he] interpreted the republican principles of the Revolution, [and] how those principles shaped his life after April 19, 1775.' She succeeds admirably in all those goals."&#x2015;<i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>"Triber's well-substantiated thesis is that Paul Revere was an excellent representative of an eighteenth-century artisan/mechanic culture, which sought, not entirely successfully, to bridge the gap between artisans and the social and political elite. It is the author's plausible contention that as a leader of an emerging working class, Revere, 'a true republican,' should be considered along with his more famous elite colleagues as one of the creators of the American republic. A comprehensive bibliography, index, and numerous illustrations greatly enhance the value of this long-needed, full-length biography."&#x2015;<i>The Historian</i><br><br>"The best full biography we have of Revere."&#x2015;Gordon S. Wood, , author of <i>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</i><br><br>"Based on extensive work in the papers of Revere and his contemporaries, as well as in the Boston press, this book provides a solid, believable picture of Revere. It will become the first resort for scholars looking for information on Revere and his connections and will fill an important gap in the literature of the period. Its clear writing and relative brevity should make it valuable for classroom use and there should be a broader interest from general readers."&#x2015;Steven C.

G�ring says, &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you jump?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>When a woman told this joke in Germany in 1943, she was arrested by the Nazis and sentenced to death by guillotine&#x2014;it didn&#x2019;t matter that her husband was a good German soldier who died in battle.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this groundbreaking work of history, Rudolph Herzog takes up such stories to show how widespread humor was during the Third Reich. It&#x2019;s a fascinating and frightening history: from the suppression of the anti-Nazi cabaret scene of the 1930s, to jokes made at the expense of the Nazis during WWII, to the collections of &#x201c;whispered jokes&#x201d; that were published in the immediate aftermath of the war.<br>&nbsp;<br>Herzog argues that jokes provide a hitherto missing chapter of WWII history. The jokes show that not all Germans were hypnotized by Nazi propaganda, and, in taking on subjects like Nazi concentration camps, they record a public acutely aware of the horrors of the regime. Thus <i>Dead Funny</i> is a tale of terrible silence and cowardice, but also of occasional and inspiring bravery.</p><p><b>RUDOLPH HERZOG</b>&nbsp;is a historian and filmmaker.

It was a wonderful world that had opened to them--of vast surroundings, spacious inland seas, numerous channels and islands of untold number. From the mast tops or from the decks of the ships,the sailors gazed on magnificent forests and great mountains, some to the north (now known as the Cascades) and some inland from where they were. At sea level they were thousands of feet below the great Olympic range, with its own sentinel, named by Meares Mount Olympus. To the north, and in the immediate space that stretched out before them,lay the great slumbering strait connecting the Pacific and the Salish Sea. Native canoes there were, of that we are sure. No other sail was to be seen anywhere, no commercial traffic. It was an empty shipping lane. Across that body of water lay the continent, possibly (actually, as they were to learn after months of inquiry, it was a great island, later named Vancouver Island). What fantastic visions must have passed through the minds of the ships' companies. Thoughts of despair may also have crossed their minds:how were they to complete the exploration of this complex body of water and rock? What, indeed, were its secrets, and could these be unravelled?<br>The challenges of command were daunting, and how was the whole to be arranged for this limitless exploration?

How can artists themselves shape the social relevance and impact of their work? In <i>How to Do Things with Art</i>, German art historian Dorothea von Hantelmann uses four case study artists--Daniel Buren, James Coleman, Jeff Koons and Tino Sehgal--to examine how an artwork acts upon and within social conventions, particularly through the "performing" of exhibitions. The book's title is a play on J.L. Austin's seminal text, <i>How to Do Things with Words</i>, which describes language's reality-producing properties and demonstrates that in "saying" there is always a "doing"--a linguistic counterpart to the dynamics envisioned by Von Hantelmann for art, in which "showing" is a kind of "doing." Von Hantelmann's close analysis of works by Buren, Coleman, Koons and Sehgal explores how each of these artists has taken control of how their work conducts itself in the world.</p><p></p><h2>GOLDSMITHS (MEDIEVAL CRAFTSMEN SERIES) /ANGLAIS</h2><p><p>Of all the medieval craftsmen, the goldsmith worked on the two most valuable materials - gold and silver - and set them with rare stones and classical gems.

In the unusual world of Green Town, Illinois, a 12-year-old discovers the wonders of reality and the power of imagination during the summer of 1928</p><p>World-renowned fantasist Ray Bradbury has on several occasions stepped outside the arenas of horror, fantasy, and science fiction. An unabashed romantic, his first novel in 1957 was basically a love letter to his childhood. (For those who want to undertake an even more evocative look at the dark side of youth, five years later the author would write the chilling classic <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>.) <p> <i>Dandelion Wine</i> takes us into the summer of 1928, and to all the wondrous and magical events in the life of a 12-year-old Midwestern boy named Douglas Spaulding. This tender, openly affectionate story of a young man's voyage of discovery is certainly more mainstream than exotic. No walking dead or spaceships to Mars here. Yet those who wish to experience the unique magic of early Bradbury as a prose stylist should find <i>Dandelion Wine</i> most refreshing. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i></p>The summer of '28 was a vintag season for a growing boy. A summer of green apple trees, mowed lawns, and new sneakers. Of half-burnt firecrackers, of gathering dandelions, of Grandma's belly-busting dinner.

Chaplin&#x2019;s near-Dickensian childhood was one of squalid poverty in London. Both parents were in show business, and alcoholism and syphilis blighted their lives. At seven, Charlie was committed to the Hanwell School for Orphans and Destitute Children. According to Weissman, Chaplin recreated his painful childhood over and over in his movies, especially through the adventures of Chaplin&#x2019;s archetypal film persona, the Little Tramp, the comical and lovable Everyman who never gives up. Weissman finds many parallels between Chaplin&#x2019;s upbringing and what he presented on the big screen; indeed, he maintains that the films are deeply personal statements reflecting the formative influence of early poverty on his artistic development. Besides being a captivating psychological study of a seminal figure in motion-picture history, the book is an engaging survey of early Hollywood filmmaking. --June Sawyers</p><h2>Revelations for a New Millenium: Saintly and Celestial Prophecies of Joy and Renewal</h2><p>The author of Angel Answers describes what lies ahead based on his interpretations of God and the holy and describes what a holy person might do in the coming era by learning from the lessons of the past.

But the newest contender in this savage arena, as demonic to behold as he is deadly to challenge, is fighting for more than just survival. His do-or-die mission, for the dark masters he serves, is to capture the ultimate weapon: an object that will enable the Sith to conquer the galaxy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sith lords Darth Plagueis and Darth Sidious are determined to possess the prize. And one of the power-hungry duo has his own treacherous plans for it. But first, their fearsome apprentice must take on a bloodthirsty prison warden, a cannibal gang, cutthroat crime lord Jabba the Hutt, and an unspeakable alien horror. No one else could brave such a gauntlet of death and live. But no one else is the dreaded dark-side disciple known as Darth Maul.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Lockdown</i></b> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Schreiber . . . was a great choice for this novel, imbuing the story with a dark, foreboding tone while never quite stepping into the horror territories that <i>Death Troopers</i> and <i>Red Harvest</i> took us.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Jedi News</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Fans of the dark side should rejoice. <i>Lockdown</i> delivers a can&#x2019;t-put-this-down tale of scum and villainy.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Club Jade</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;[<i>Lockdown </i>is] an action-packed ride that spins one entertaining chapter after another. The multiple layers of story keeps readers guessing what will happen next and just who will live and who will die. . . . It certainly adds to the character of Darth Maul while matching [<i>Darth</i>] <i>Plagueis</i>&#x2019;s complexity with sheer fun. . . . Five out of five metal bikinis.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Roqoo Depot</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;Somehow, Schreiber is able to skate the line between hard-hitting prison story and the adventure and excitement I love from <i>Star Wars</i> in a way that doesn&#x2019;t betray either genre.

I&#x2019;ll have to keep an eye out for more <i>Star Wars</i> books from Schreiber.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Seattle Geekly</i></b><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p><b>Joe Schreiber</b> is the author of several novels, including <i>Star Wars: Red Harvest, Star Wars: Death Troopers, Chasing the Dead, </i>and<i> Au Revoir, Crazy European Chick</i>. He was born in Michigan but spent his formative years in Alaska, Wyoming, and Northern California. He lives in central Pennsylvania with his wife and two children.1<br><br>Cog Hive Seven<br><br>Wham!<br><br>The first punch came at Maul sideways, spinning his upper body around with the sheer force of the impact and driving him back a half step before he fully recovered his equilibrium. Somewhere under his feet, the alloy plates of the cell&#x2019;s floor seemed to shiver and quake, threatening to give way.<br><br>He spat out a tooth and wiped away the blood.<br><br>The creature in front of him was a walking trophy case of previous kills. Two and a half meters high, its massive shoulders and upper torso encased in jagged plates of primitive armor that clearly had once served as the jawbone and carapace of a much larger predator, it seemed to occupy an entire corner of the prison cell.<br><br>Maul stared at the thing. The gray slope of its face was a surgeon&#x2019;s nightmare of ritualistic scars, metal rings and studs, wire loops, and hooks, with bluish sacks pulsating beneath its eyes, all of it siphoning down and inward toward a gaping, razor-toothed mouth. Even its arms seemed to have been plucked from two different organisms. The right hand was a blunt-knuckled fist, the left an elongated spider-fingered claw. Together they formed a mallet and blade, one made for pounding, the other for slashing. It was the right that had come careening out of nowhere just seconds before, slamming Maul backward and knocking out one of his teeth.<br><br>The thing reached down and picked up Maul&#x2019;s incisor from the floor of the cell. Straightening up, it shoved the tooth into an empty space in its own mouth, twisting it until it lodged in place. Then it grinned at Maul as if asking how he liked the sight of one of his teeth in its mouth&#x2014;another trophy for its collection.<br><br>Maul gazed back at it.<br><br>And then the rage came.<br><br>And the rage was good.<br><br>The uniform they&#x2019;d given him was a standard orange jumpsuit whose heavy fabric cut off movement in most directions. Maul heard its seams ripping as he sprang at his opponent, closing the half-meter gap between them in less than a second. The thing responded exactly as he&#x2019;d hoped, lunging up eagerly to meet his advance. Its mismatched arms pinwheeled wildly before it, swinging and clawing through the stale gray air of the cell, its voice screeching at him in a guttural, choking language he&#x2019;d never heard before.<br><br>Let those be your dying words, Maul thought. Right here. Today.<br><br>Close enough now that he could smell the corpse-stink pouring off it like rotten meat, he fell into a reflexive series of moves. Both hands shot out and grabbed the creature by its throat, hoisting it up over his head and squeezing until he felt the deep tendons of its neck beginning to give and weaken in his grip. There was a wet, muffled click from somewhere inside the thing&#x2019;s chest and a sudden glut of warm, thick, sticky fluid began spurting up from its throat.<br><br>Blood.<br><br>Jet black.<br><br>The sight of it gave Maul no satisfaction, only the vaguely annoying realization that it never should have taken him this long to turn the battle to his advantage. Still, ending his opponent&#x2019;s life quickly would restore a certain necessary balance to the encounter&#x2014;if not honor, at least vindication. He tightened his grip, and the screaming sound got louder, becoming a broken, birdlike squawk. More blood leapt up, inky black and viscous, and started pouring from its mouth and eye sockets.<br><br>Enough.<br><br>Executing a perfectly balanced spin, Maul swung the creature around and slammed it to the floor with a sharp clang, connecting hard enough that he felt the steel plates reverberate under his feet. The thing&#x2019;s head drooped on its broken neck, lolling sideways to expose the throbbing vessels beneath its gray flesh.<br><br>Only now did Maul allow himself to exhale. As anticipated, he hadn&#x2019;t needed his lightsaber staff or the Force to dispatch this waste of flesh&#x2014;not that either was really an option. Staring down into the thing&#x2019;s face, he raised his foot and planted his heel in the exposed throat, ready to pulverize the trachea, or whatever the thing used for an airway, with one decisive stomp. For an instant he met its sagging, inarticulate eyes.<br><br>Now, he instructed the thing, which seemed to be realizing that it was destined to finish out the final pathetic seconds of its life here in nameless obscurity. Die.<br><br>All at once, with blinding speed, the creature yanked loose and burst upright, reaching behind its back to produce what appeared to be a long bow staff. As the staff blurred toward him, Maul realized that the weapon, which he&#x2019;d first taken to be a piece of wood or some kind of biomechanical hybrid, was actually a living organism&#x2014;a serpent whose head lashed out at lightning velocity, latching onto his face, slashing at his eyes.<br><br>Maul recoiled, but it was too late. With a jolt, his vision was gone, burying him in instant darkness. This was the second time in as many seconds that the thing had caught him off guard, and now he knew why: the creature was somehow cut off from the Force, utterly detached from the deep field of heightened sensitivity from which he was constantly drawing information about his surroundings. The intuitive sensory abilities that he took for granted in any normal battle were simply not there.<br><br>An acidic heaviness took hold of his optic nerves like a slow drip, seeping in, sinking deep, and he realized that he could already feel the poison taking control, spreading out in concentric layers of numbness through the muscle and tissue of his face.<br><br>Now the thing&#x2019;s shrieking laughter was everywhere. Willful. Triumphant.<br><br>You must end this now.<br><br>Maul straightened. The voice in his head was his own, an austere evocation of his own training. But the cadence was unmistakably his Master&#x2019;s&#x2014;an echo of pitiless instruction, hours, days, years of unyielding pain and discipline. Sidious was never far from him. The evocation of the Sith Lord&#x2019;s presence here snapped him back instantly into the moment with total clarity.<br><br>Reaching up through blindness, Maul took hold of the serpent, grappling with its fully extended length. Somewhere in the void he could feel the rippling leathery sinew of the staff looping around his neck, felt the hundreds of small muscles twisting and constricting over his windpipe, pinching off his airway like a living noose. The next few seconds would be crucial.<br><br>He flexed, bent his head, and jerked it forward, but the thing would not release. It kept encircling him, looping round and round, defying every attempt to take hold of it.<br><br>Maul willed himself to be absolutely still, a study in perfect rigidity, allowing the serpent, in its moment of fatal overconfidence, to draw tighter still, stretching itself until he sensed its head coming back around in front of him once more. Still he waited. Above it all he could smell his opponent&#x2019;s fetid stench, could feel the claws of his opponent raking his skin, twisting into his face, gouging for purchase. It shrieked at him, and this time the cry was pure victory, what might even have been laughter. Starved, insane. A warrior with nothing to lose.<br><br>You are no warrior, Maul thought. You know nothing of the dark side.<br><br>The moment had come. He grasped the head of the amphistaff, seizing its blunt nose and fanged mouth. His fingers took hold of its distended upper part, twisting, wrenching, until he tore the serpent&#x2019;s head off its body with a moist and meaty pop.<br><br>The results were instantaneous. With a twitching galvanic shudder, the snake loosened and fell slack, the coils already beginning to slide from his neck, and Maul allowed himself a single, unobstructed breath before finishing his work here.<br><br>Somewhere in front of him, the attacker had already responded to the death of his weapon with a howl of cheated rage. Maul no longer heard it. Primal as it was, it was still only emotion, a cry of weakness no more instructive or relevant than the pain he&#x2019;d willed away moments earlier. He had no more use for it now than he ever did.<br><br>He did, however, take advantage of his opponent&#x2019;s scream just long enough to reach into its open mouth, feeling the moist warmth of its breath on his hand as he retrieved his tooth, plucking it from the thing&#x2019;s gums. Holding the mouth agape, Maul crammed the serpent&#x2019;s severed head inside, then clamped the gray lips tight to keep the snake&#x2019;s head from falling out. He ripped three of the larger piercings from the thing&#x2019;s right arm and jammed them upward through the lips, bending them back into barbed hooks and fastening the mouth shut with the serpent&#x2019;s head still trapped inside. With his hands flattened against those lips, Maul could feel the head twitching around inside the mouth, sinking its fangs in reflexively, squirting out venom while his attacker jerked and spasmed and tried in vain to scream.<br><br>End it.<br><br>Still sightless, now holding his opponent at arm&#x2019;s length, Maul inclined his own head down. He thrust forward, driving his horns into the thing&#x2019;s sagging eyes, feeling them crushed to jelly against his scalp.<br><br>The spasms stopped, and Maul stepped back, releasing the body, allowing it to collapse at his feet.<br><br>He blinked and narrowed his own still-burning eyes, clutching his tooth in his hand. His vision was already starting to come back in murky shades of gunmetal gray and metallic blue. The process was infuriatingly slow, but it was happening. There was no reason not to assume that within a few hours, he would be fully recovered, and when&#x2014;<br><br>The floor began to shake.<br><br>Maul whipped around, scanning the depths of his cell for the vibration&#x2019;s source. From all around him, a ratcheting cacophony had taken hold of the cell, the sound of massive chains being dragged through the sprockets and pulleys of some vast piece of clockwork. It filled the entire chamber, rising to a deafening roar. Everything around him had begun to shift and tilt. Maul reached out, fingertips confirming what he&#x2019;d already begun to suspect.<br><br>The walls were closing in.<br><br>This was no illusion, no side effect of crippled vision. The cell itself was literally changing shape&#x2014;the individual steel plates that formed the walls and floors and ceiling all overlapping and sliding together like great mechanical scales, curving inward as the slant of its floor became steeper, transforming into a kind of bowl, opening in the middle to create a funnel.<br><br>Reaching backward, Maul grabbed the handhold bolted into the bench behind him, clutching it for balance and holding on tight. All around him, the grating howl and shriek of metal got louder as a hole opened in the middle of the floor.<br><br>He furrowed his brow, squinting down into it. His vision had become clear enough now that he could make out the lifeless corpse of his former attacker, the thing in its broken and now utterly useless organic armor sliding downward toward the center of the cell. It sagged forward on a streaking smear of its own black blood, a slave to simple physics, its passage into oblivion followed in short order by the limp, decapitated body of the snake-staff.<br><br>Maul watched as warrior and staff both slipped through the hole and out of sight into a bath of darkness almost as deep as the one from which he himself had just emerged. For an instant&#x2014;was it real?&#x2014;he thought he saw something pale and eyeless reaching up to suck the bodies down.<br><br>The hole closed again and the floor shifted itself, smoothing out and becoming flat once more. The clanking and shaking stopped. The cell around him had resumed its previous rectilinear shape.<br><br>Somewhere in front of him, a panel of red lights blinked and went green.<br><br>He waited as the cell began to carry him upward.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>All Said and Done (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>The celebrated feminist and existentialist looks back on her later years, reevaluates incidents in her past, and shares her outlook on life</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Maine Reader: The Down East Experience from 1614 to the Present</h2><p>Here, in one large volume, is a book that captures the full sweep of Maine&#39;s culture and history, from the first dazzled vision of the European explorers to the modern prose of Carolyn Chute and John McPhee.

The teachings contained in it were given to him by his Master in preparing him for Initiation, and were written down by him from memory - slowly and laboriously, for his English last year was far less fluent than it is now. The greater part is a reproduction of the Master&#39;s own words; that which is not such a verbal reproduction is the Master&#39;s thought clothed in His pupil&#39;s words. Two omitted sentences were supplied by the Master. In two other cases an omitted word has been added. Beyond this, it is entirely Alcyone&#39;s own, his first gift to the world. May it help others as the spoken teachings helped him - such is the hope with which he gives it. But the teaching can only be fruitful if it is lived, as he has lived it, since it fell from the Master&#39;s lips. If the example be followed as well as the precept, then for the reader, as for the writer, shall the great Portal swing open, and his feet be set on the Path. Annie Besant.</p><p>J. Krishnamurti (1895-1986) was a renowned spiritual teacher whose lectures and writings have inspired thousands. His works include On Mind and Thought, On Nature and the Environment, On Relationship, On Living and Dying, On Love and Lonliness, On Fear, and On Freedom.<br><br>Jiddu Krishnamurti lived from 1895 to 1986, and is regarded as one of the greatest philosophical and spiritual figures of the twentieth century. He was first discovered by the Theosophists on a beach in South India in 1910 at the age of 13 and was educated to be the new World Teacher for the ages. Then he took an extraordinary turn. In 1929, at one of the enormous annual European gatherings of the Theosophists in Holland, he announced his decision to step down from any formal role to promote him as a World Teacher, resigned as figure head of the Theosophists, and cut all ties to any notion of a religious or spiritual organization.Krishnamurti claimed no allegiance to any caste, nationality or religion and was bound by no tradition. His purpose was to set humankind unconditionally free from the destructive limitations of a conditioned mind. For nearly sixty years, he traveled the world and spoke spontaneously to large audiences until the end of his life in 1986 at the age of 90. He had no permanent home, but when not traveling, he often stayed in Ojai, California, Brockwood Park, England, and in Chennai, India. In his talks, he pointed out to people the need to transform themselves through self knowledge, by being aware of the subtleties of their thoughts and feelings in daily life, and how this movement can be observed through the mirror of relationship.</p><h2>How to Judge a Horoscope, Vol. 1</h2><p>How to Judge a Horoscope is a departure from the conventional method of treatment of astrology.

Initiating contact with figures like Zen scholar D.T. Suzuki, Thich Nhat Hanh, and Rabbi Abraham Heschel, he sought not only to expand his understanding of other faiths, but to find like-minded friends who might share his dream of a global community of the spirit. Such people, whom he called living &#34;sacraments&#34; or signs of peace, were those &#34;able to unite in themselves and experience in their own lives all that is best and most true in the numerous spiritual traditions.&#34;</p><p>William Apel is Professor of Religious Studies at Linfield College, Oregon. His books include Silent Conversations: Reading the Bible in Good Company."Thomas Merton's ecumenical concerns are highlighted in this timely volume. It demonstrates convincingly Merton's continual growth in ecumenical dialogue from his first encounters with Christians of various religious persuasions to Jewish, Islamic, and non-Christian traditions of the Far East." -- Brother Patrick Hart, Abbey of Gethsemani<br><br>"No current issue is more urgent than interfaith relations today, and no writer, past or present, has given us greater insight into effecting reconciliation among representatives of the worlds religions than Thomas Merton." -- E.

Miller's acclaimed SF classic <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> opens with the accidental excavation of a holy artifact: a creased, brittle memo scrawled by the hand of the blessed Saint Leibowitz, that reads: "Pound pastrami, can kraut, six bagels--bring home for Emma." To the Brothers of Saint Leibowitz, this sacred shopping list penned by an obscure, 20th-century engineer is a symbol of hope from the distant past, from before the Simplification, the fiery atomic holocaust that plunged the earth into darkness and ignorance. As <i>1984</i> cautioned against Stalinism, so 1959's <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> warns of the threat and implications of nuclear annihilation. Following a cloister of monks in their Utah abbey over some six or seven hundred years, the funny but bleak <i>Canticle</i> tackles the sociological and religious implications of the cyclical rise and fall of civilization, questioning whether humanity can hope for more than repeating its own history. Divided into three sections--<i>Fiat Homo</i> (Let There Be Man), <i>Fiat Lux</i> (Let There Be Light), and <i>Fiat Voluntas Tua</i> (Thy Will Be Done)--<i>Canticle</i> is steeped in Catholicism and Latin, exploring the fascinating, seemingly capricious process of how and why a person is canonized. <i>--Paul Hughes</i>"Extraordinary...chillingly effective."<br><i>--Time</i><p>"Angry, eloquent...a terrific story."<br><i>--The New York Times</i></p><p>"An extraordinary novel...Prodigiously imaginative, richly comic, terrifyingly grim, profound both intellectually and morally, and, above all...simply such a memorable story as to stay with the reader for years."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><p>"An exciting and imaginative story...Unconditionally recommended."<br><i>--Library Journal</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Sake: A Drinker&#39;s Guide</h2><p>This illustrated guide covers all the reader needs to know about Japan&#39;s national drink.

Its premise is that the fisherman is a hunter, and that to be skillful and successful in his pursuit he must understand his quarry intimately. <p>Lee Wulff draws on nearly three quarters of a century of serious angling to explain what a trout will do under various circumstances, why it takes up a particular position in a river, why and when it feeds as it does, what we must know to bring it to our fly. His perceptions appear deceptively simple, as only a master's analyses can seem. Through Wulff's eyes, we understand the many factors that affect the tout and our pursuit - temperature, stream flow, the different types of water in a river, approach and presentation, tactics, and flies and their structures. Throughout, there is the innovative mind of a great fisherman not solving a trout fisherman's problems for him but requiring that a fisherman learn to solve them for himself. </p><p>Trout on a Fly is for all serious trout fishermen; it is the kind of book that can change the way a fisherman sees and approaches the trout and its world. (51/4 X 81/4, 192 pages, b&amp;w photos, illustrations, diagrams)</p></p><p>Another entry in the crowded field of fly fishing primers, loosely defined, seems hardly cause for jubilation. But Wulff, a highly respected veteran fisher and author, has put together a superb and understated little volume that may well be the best book of angling advice in the last 20 years. Although chapter headings promise the standard range of subjects (e.g., "Trout Vision," "Casting"), Wulff delivers more experience and insight and wastes less time elucidating the obvious than the majority of his fellow authors. His book can be read with profit by an intelligent beginner, but it will be even better appreciated by the experienced. Wulff presents his topic with the sure touch of a master teacher, who after 75 years can readily penetrate to the heart of his subjects. David J.

Heartbroken over losing their sister Rose and wanted by the law, Jack heads to the only place for wild souls like himself: the rough-and-tumble gambling town of Virginia City. What he finds there outshines any prize won at the gaming tables -- he discovers Lillie, the down-to-earth card dealer who could be the love of his life. But just as Jack makes a fresh start, a murderous enemy crosses his path -- an explosive twist of fate that forces Jack to leave Lillie and sends him on the run once again. <br> Out on the trail, wounded and half-starved, Jack is rescued by Raven, a beautiful Blackfoot woman, and with her tribe he finds the peace he seeks. But unseen adventures -- some tragic, some redemptive -- await Jack before he finds a place to call home....Written on the run or by the campfire light, in times of joy and grief, Jack's letters to Callie reveal his unforgettable journey as it unfolds -- and stand as a moving testament to the strength of the human spirit.</p><p>Dawn Miller is the author of several novels, including <i>The Journal of Callie Wade </i>and <i>The Prophecy</i>. She is a member of numerous Western associations and a collector of classic Western literature, pioneer diaries, and journals.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br><i>Virginia City,<br><br>Montana Territory<br><br>March 19, 1864<br><br>Mrs. Callie McGregor<br><br>Plumas City, California<br><br>Dear Callie,<br><br>Well, I'm here and Virginia City ain't exactly pretty. But she is a sight for these sore eyes.<br><br>It's fourteen crowded miles of miner's sin here, as Ma would call it, more saloons, gambling dens, and dance halls than I ever saw. And slapped up quick, too. If it weren't for the mountains, I'd think a good wind might blow it all away -- but I'm hoping it won't. I have a hunch if I play my cards right, this place just might be my ticket to a new start. <br><br>And truth is, I don't know how many of them tickets I have left.<br><br>I swear, I ain't ever seen so much coming and going since we joined that wagon train back in Independence. By God, but it is good to see people again! Makes me think I ought to stay here awhile. I guess I'm just sick to death of being on the run. I imagine I'm far enough from the trouble I wrote you of, too. Even if I ain't, this would be one hard place to find someone who didn't want to be found. If I can just fade into these crowds for awhile, I might buy enough time to sort things out. Might be I can hit some paydirt, too -- mine the miners, so the saying goes. I swear, you can almost smell the gold on the fellows walking by. <br><br>Well, if Lady Luck's finally invited me to the party, I guess I ought to quit this letter for now and scrounge up a room so I can clean myself up for the doings. Ain't no time like the present to dust off and get back to living. <br><br>Funny. You know what I keep thinking about? Remember what Grandma Wade said to me that time that bully tried to get the better of me? She said, "Jack, you lay down once and you'll end up stayin' there. Next thing you know some feller's tossin' dirt over you." Well, I got up -- just like the old lady expected -- and I aim to this time, too. <br><br>I guess it's in the blood, Sis. We Wades ain't made to stay down long.<br><br>Jack</i><br><br>If women and whiskey were at a premium in Virginia City, rooms were worth the mother lode and a lot harder to find. Jack rubbed the shadow of a beard on his face and considered his dilemma as he watched the fracas going on along the bog of mud and manure that was Jackson Street. With the sun fading behind the mountains, the gulch seemed to come alive quick like a shaky drunk after downing his first drink of the night. The street was jammed with even more people, if that was possible; prospectors and cowhands, ladies both painted and proper, sharing leg room with the horses, oxen, and stray hogs that stood in the road, driving up the mud and the stink. <br><br>Still, it was life, Jack figured. And underneath all that raunch was opportunity.<br><br>But it was more the sounds that drew him in every time; the raucous laughter that spilled from the doorways, the arguing and the crack of gunfire, the call for a new game -- it all helped him to drown out his failings for awhile. And whatever he won in gambling just helped him to keep moving and forgetting. The risks were worth it as long as he could forget. <br><br>Time alone hadn't been much of a healer.<br><br>Jack's eyes strayed for only a moment to the other side of town, the side he figured to stay clear of, where there were finer buildings, houses, and a school and all. It was the comfortable side, with its families that reminded him so sharply of Callie and the little sister he'd failed. Somewhere -- probably when he'd left the wagon train behind in Salt Lake, after he'd built the coffin for little Rose with his own two hands -- he'd given up that part of himself, his history. Sorrows could kill a man quicker than anything he knew if he gave in to them.<br><br>He knew most folks looking at him never would have guessed his history because of the mask he hid behind, always good for a story or joke to make them laugh. It didn't take long to figure out that it was better for the game to keep up a cheerful outlook. It was only in his heart where nobody could see that he kept his distance. He had learned all too well that it never paid to get too close because what you cared for could be lost. Which was why he preferred poker, he thought, looking around. Money wasn't so hard to lose -- and he rarely did. <br><br>Jack was pulled from his thoughts as another squabble suddenly erupted in the street. This time, it appeared to be between a scrawny auctioneer who hogged a good part of the street with his animals and a big fellow who had been trying his best to park his rig. The black man was about the tallest Jack had ever seen and had arms as big around as small trees. Jack watched with interest as the black man quietly pondered his dilemma, then promptly halted his team dead center of the selling, stepped off into the ankle-deep mud, and solemnly trudged by. The auctioneer had been ready for a fight until he realized the man's size. So, he waited to holler until the man got far enough down the plank walk, then put himself into a lather that was comical, drawing more of the crowd's attention.<br><br>"If you're looking for civilization, mister, it's two streets over," came a sudden female voice, causing a healthy roar of laughter from the crowd. "If not, come on in and try your luck. We're the only place around that'll guarantee you a square deal."<br><br>Jack craned his neck and saw the woman standing just inside the doorway of a ramshackle affair with a sign overhead dubbing it "Pair-O-Dice." She was small but built generous with a fine head of brown curls piled high and a nice smile that faded as the hawker carried on about <i>Negroes</i> and <i>not having brains enough to think.</i><br><br>"I guess you're right," she called. "Had the man been <i>thinkin',</i> he'd have just shot you."<br><br>The little auctioneer looked startled. <br><br>"Ain't no woman that would've mouthed me like that back home," he declared, but Jack hardly paid any attention. He was watching the woman as she turned back into the saloon with the rough bunch of lean, gaunt-faced miners trailing behind her like schoolboys. She had to have sand to handle a crowd like that, he thought admiringly. These were the kind of people who worked hard and played harder. As he watched the last of the crowd file in, he felt the familiar rush of a new game build in him. <br><br><i>"...No</i> woman," the little man repeated loudly as he set to gathering the animals that he'd been hawking. Jack grinned at him, suddenly feeling in better spirits. <br><br>"Well, if you ain't goin' to take the lady up on the invite to play I guess I should," he said, proceeding into the Pair-O-Dice. Hesitating queered the luck as far as he was concerned -- and that was just how he felt, lucky. Stepping through the batwings, he heard a fiddler strike up a lively tune somewhere in the crowded tobacco haze. A smallish bartender with a sorrowful expression glanced up and Jack saw his eyes rest briefly on the tied-down holsters before he went back to mopping the bar. A ragged dove smiled an invitation, but when she saw he wasn't interested, the light in her eyes faded and she tottered on back through the crowd. Jack heard the familiar husky female laugh then, followed by the constant clack of chips being shuffled, and he moved in closer to the faro layout at the back of the room. <br><br>"Remember boys, it's all about faith. The more you bet, the more you're likely to win," the lady dealer said, smiling as she drew winners and losers from the case box. "Reverend Webb, you of all people should know that."<br><br>The men all laughed at the sally, but Jack couldn't help to notice how far off the lady dealer seemed in spite of her friendliness. Up close, her face was fair and distractingly pretty with a pair of large blue eyes that appeared set on a thought of somewhere else, though the other boys didn't seem to notice. He guessed more than half of them were there just to look at her. She was fresh looking -- that alone could do it in a place where most women appeared dried up or wilted.<br><br>He watched the game for a bit as she calmly called winner or loser, then stepped forward and slid a chip to the seven, coppering it at the last minute with the token that marked it to lose. She glanced up at him briefly, her eyes staying on him a bit longer than he expected, then drew a five of clubs, loser, and ten of diamonds, winner. He shrugged off the loss as minor and studied the dealer as she collected his chips off the table. He noticed the mending done in her silk dress and thought she couldn't be getting much of the rake-off. But the stubborn set of her chin said she wanted more. There seemed something lonely about her too, he saw, but he was quick to brush the thought aside. <br><br>"Last bid, gentlemen," she announced, drawing down to the hock, "all or nothing."<br><br>"Wouldn't none of us be standin' here if we didn't want it all," Jack said and a few of the men chuckled, not noticing he was looking at the dealer and not at the table. The woman they called Lillie was no fool, though. He saw her eyes go a bit wider, but she quickly recovered and gave him a grin that caused the dimples in her cheeks to appear. <br><br>"Wantin' and gettin' is two different things," she said finally. Lillie shuffled the cards easy then laid them before Jack to cut. After he did, she set them in the case box and Jack slid a chip to the ace of hearts. She pulled a six and a queen and slid Jack's chips off of the layout. She then drew the two of clubs for him, loser, then the ace of hearts, winner. Lillie gave him a wry smile that said, <i>You see?</i><br><br>Jack grunted. The thing was, he didn't see. He had had the gut feeling when he stepped through the door that his luck was about to change. The first time he didn't so much mind it, but the second time he'd felt sure and his feelings weren't usually wrong. Faro had never been his best game -- not like poker or three-card monte -- but he wasn't a slouch at it, either. <br><br>By the time she took the third round of wagers, Jack suspected she had an edge of some kind, but he was hard put to figure out what. As close as he looked, he saw no sign of the usual cheats: spring or sliding plate. When he finally glanced up and their eyes met again, it was with silent regard, like two war-weary soldiers who had come face to face only to realize they were fighting for the same thing.<br><br>Survival.<br><br>She grinned and Jack smiled in return. But he was forced to step back from the faro layout just the same. He'd had a mind to stay in her game until he figured it out, but his funds wouldn't allow it. Nothing aggravated him more than having to be cautious -- especially when a challenge had been laid down. <br><br>He felt her curious eyes stay on him as he felt for the small wad of greenbacks tucked inside the money belt beneath his vest. He had sold his saddle and rifle for a lot less than their worth, but he had figured it to be enough to get into a poker game. The rest would take care of itself. He winked at Lillie to let her know he wasn't finished, then started back across the room. <br><br>He had no problem finding a game. The three miners were a friendly bunch who appeared tired of their own company and quickly offered him a chair. One of the miners who sat across from him was so caught up in asking Jack about his travels that he kept spitting tobacco on the floor instead of in the spittoon that was provided. Jack had no more dealt the cards when he saw the sorrowful-looking bartender march toward them, his thin face turning red clear to the bald area on his head. The bartender grabbed the closest spittoon and dropped it so hard that it bounced once and sloshed over a bit before resting next to the miner's mud-caked boot, then he stalked off. <br><br>The old miner didn't seem to take offense. <br><br>"Ely's got bad nerves," he confided solemnly, then smiled. "But he's the only feller I know that'll believe an outright lie when ya want to tell one."<br><br>"Why, that's the best kind of fellow to have around," Jack chuckled, grateful for the bartender's nerves; the miner's endless questions were starting to make him uneasy. His hand was called then and he peered over his cards, at ease again. "Well, boys, as my sainted Pa used to say, the safest bets are the ones you don't make." Jack laid his cards down, displaying his flush, and the men laughed amiably. They even laughed when he won the second hand?they cursed too, of course, but it was good-natured cursing.<br><br>"Where're you from?" the curious miner asked again, as the dove served them another round of drinks. Jack saw his friend kick him under the table to silence him, his eyes darting to the guns, and he smiled slightly. <br><br>"Oh, here and there," he replied softly, glancing back to the lady dealer again. She had kept his interest throughout the evening and he had found it more and more of a burden to keep his eyes from straying over to her table for a look. Not that he was interested in another go at faro -- he preferred games where the odds were more in his favor, he thought, brushing the fattened bankroll in his vest. There was just something about her....<br><br>"She a sport?" Jack asked finally, inclining his head toward Lillie. The old fellow glanced at Lillie then grunted and let loose a stream of tobacco, this time careful to aim it into the spittoon.<br><br>"Only when she wants to be," he replied disgustedly, as if she were a disgrace to her profession, but he immediately became contrite. "Most every feller in here's tried for her. Harm here oiled his hair and turned his paper collar twice in one week. I, myself, even offered to marry her," he sighed. "She's a challenge." <br><br>Jack raked in the third pot with a thoughtful expression on his face. He had always liked a challenge. <br><br>He smiled a bit as his eyes slid over to the lady dealer again, thinking Virginia City might just have more possibilities than he thought, after all.<br><br>There were only a few stragglers left in the saloon by the time Jack dealt the last card to Lillie: Ely, the bartender, the dove he'd seen earlier, and the fiddler. The fiddler, who had turned to song after drinking all night, had passed out in mid-chorus of "I Miss My Sainted Mother, Now that She's Dead and Gone to Heaven" and was still lying on the floor where he dropped. Ely swept around him as if he were a permanent fixture, while the dove called Mabel picked through the broken glass and clumps of mud for loose change or dust that had fallen from the miners' pockets. <br><br>Jack glanced at Lillie, who sat across the table from him. She had a distant look on her face, but he had seen a difference in her when she had won the first hand; she had looked almost like a young girl and had even laughed outright. As lonely as he had been, he almost wanted her to win just to see that expression again. Jack had a feeling she wanted it as well but for different reasons; she had already sent the bartender to her room twice for money and she had begun to look hesitant as he dealt them another round.<br><br>He himself hadn't drawn a bad card since they sat down together, and the relief to be back on familiar ground made him bold. He was sometimes shocked at his own thoughts, but the truth was he didn't relish another night sleeping on the ground -- or the loss of good company. <br><br>"How 'bout we add to the stakes and make this interesting," he offered. "You win, you get the pot, naturally. But if <i>I</i> win, I get to spend the night in your room." <br><br>Mabel cackled loudly in the quiet of the room, but Ely looked almost sick with worry. "You want me to get your money, Lillie?" he asked, setting his broom down on the floor, but Lillie waved him off. <br><br>She had no intention of sending Ely up to her room again. She hadn't made do with old dresses and no jewelry just to see all of her ...</p><h2>The Bride of Lammermoor (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>The plans of Edgar, Master of Ravenswood to regain his ancient family estate from the corrupt Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland are frustrated by the complexities of the legal and political situations following the 1707 Act of Union, and by his passion for his enemy's beautiful<br>daughter Lucy.

The Complete Collection of Antiquities</h2><p><p>Antiquarian, archaeologist, vulcanologist, and envoy to the British Embassy in Naples, Sir William Hamilton (1731&#x2013;1803) was a leading European figure of his time. Though the romance between his wife Lady Emma Hamilton and Horatio Nelson tends to eclipse Sir William&#x2019;s own activities, his work as a scientist and a classicist made major contributions to the study of Pompei, Herculaneum, and Mt. Vesuvius.</p><p>As an expert in ancient art, Hamilton also built up an invaluable collection of ancient Greek vases, subsequently sold to the British Museum in London in 1772. Before the pieces were shipped off to England, Hamilton commissioned Pierre-Fran�ois Hugues d&#x2019;Hancarville, an adventurous connoisseur and art dealer, to document the vases in words and images. The resulting catalog, published in four volumes and known as Les Antiquit�s d&#x2019;Hancarville, represents a neoclassical masterpiece. Never before had ancient vases been represented with such meticulous detail and sublime beauty.</p><p>With this reprint, TASCHEN revives d&#x2019;Hancarville&#x2019;s masterful catalog for a contemporary audience, reproducing in exacting detail the same pristine images that sparked Europe&#x2019;s love affair with the classical style.</p></p><p>Madeleine Huwiler studied classical archaeology, ancient history, and old Egyptian at Fribourg University.

It's about using the unique and specialized talents of that animal, plant, or object. Nothing makes this technique and method more clear than the <em>Shapeshifter Tarot.</em></p> <p>This amazing 81-card deck follows the traditional pattern, although the names of many of the Major Arcana cards have been shifted to fit the more Pagan approach to this deck. For example, the Fool becomes Initiation, the Magician changes to the Sorcerer, and the Hermit becomes The Seer. Three additional cards, The Double, The Journey, and The Dreamer are part of the tradition on which this is based and will add additional meaning to your readings and personal work.</p> <p>And there's more! This boxed set comes with a 264-page book. Of course it has vivid interpretations of all the cards, revealing their symbolism and divinatory meanings. It also includes sample readings, key words to make readings easy, how to meditate with the cards, using the deck for spellworking, and the skill of shapeshifting itself.</p> <p>Combined with brilliant art of transcendent majesty and beauty, this uniquely shamanic deck is simply one of the most powerful Tarot decks available today. It is also one of the most potent tools for Pagans of all traditions. Whether you want this deck for personal work or for giving readings, one thing is very clear: you'll want to get and use this deck every day!</p> <p></p></p><p>A pleasure to behold! Hunt has imbued this deck with a tangible energy. Her images of humans discovering the power of the animal world evoke emotions ranging the spectrum from loneliness to joy. The expressiveness of the illustrations makes this one of the most powerful decks commercially available, well suited for use in spellcraft. Conway and Knight pool their considerable talents in the companion book, giving their lucid and vivid interpretations of the cards' literal and figurative meanings. The cards and book work together as a synergistic whole, a testament to the prowess of the authors and the illustrator. The <i>Shapeshifter Tarot</i> is analogous to the traditional tarot, save for the addition of three cards, "The Double," "The Journey," and "The Dreamer," which reflect the Celtic shamanic tradition on which this deck is based, a tradition that will teach you to access and direct animal energies to fulfill your own needs and at the same time bridge the chasm between humankind and nature. --<i>Brian Patterson</i><p>A native of the Pacific Northwest, author D.J.

With its echoes of Dante, Blake, Joyce, Kafka, and Lewis Carroll, Lanark has been published all over the world and to unanimous acclaim. This edition marks the novel&#39;s return to its original publisher and features a superb new introduction by the award-winning novelist Janice Galloway, and the author&#39;s Tailpiece, a fascinating addendum to the novel. &#34;It was time Scotland produced a shattering work of fiction in the modern idiom.

Though most of today s residents and visitors are unfamiliar with Berkeley s earliest roster of offbeat characters, their legacy became part of the foundation for one of the country s most vibrant intellectual communities. In the mid-twentieth century, Berkeley grabbed the national spotlight as a bastion of free thinkers and rabble-rousers. But the area had been long established as a fertile home for visionaries and individualists in the 1870s and 1880s, and even as far back as the gold rush era. Early Berkeley was a true frontier town embodying all the excitement, potential, and danger of America s Wild West. From the outset, it was a place where new ideas were tested, and where people who didn t feel quite at home in other locales seemed to find comfort and camaraderie. Of course, most of the town s population consisted of stalwart men and women from ranchers, road builders, and business owners to maids, saloon keepers, and farmhands who worked hard following their careers and visions of their lives. And among them lived innovators, artists, and campaigners whose head-turning discoveries and endearing antics were preserved in local newspaper accounts. These publications also captured the more sordid events of the day. In a place where urban areas hardly encroached on endless acres, disputes over land led to sad cases of murder; early attempts to mete out justice were often inconsistent and accounts of them are often baffling. Some of the events and sentiments of that era are still quietly influencing our culture today. A century or more ago, anyone on the street would have easily identified these famous local characters. Over the years their stories sadly faded from common memory. But any community will benefit from reexamining its forgotten social and cultural roots. To that end, I present this book about early Berkeley s eccentrics, heroes, and cutthroats as a tribute to all those whom ever have dreamed here or called this place home. Richard Schwartz.</p><p>editorial review newspaper Berkeley Daily PlanetAll modesty aside, we common sort can be pretty fascinating...If you want proof of this simple truth, all you have to do is pick up Richard Schwartz&#x2019;s collection of stories on Berkeley...Schwartz touches all of the abstract themes that you will find in grand histories: class struggle, ethnic conflicts, economic greed, and political intrigue. To be sure, you will meet a full cast of outlandish characters that you would expect to find in Berkeley... By the time Richard Schwartz is through with each portrait, we don&#x2019;t just know the story, we know the person... The past, as Richard Schwartz tells it, is comprised of a lot of people who look, act, and sound a lot like us. For me, at least, that is comforting news.&#x2014;David Crosson, Executive Director, California historical Society &#x201c;Combining the research skills of a careful historian with the flair of a yarn-spinner, Richard Schwartz brings early Berkeley alive with such vibrancy and immediacy that you might imagine he had witnessed it first-hand. What an informative, engaging, ultimately thought-provoking exploration of our Berkeley roots! In his many years of plowing the local soil, Schwartz brings forth a rich harvest of stories and memories that nourish a deeper sense of place.&#x201d; Malcolm Margolin, founder Heyday Books</p><h2>The Silver Princess in Oz</h2><p>Princess Planetty of Anuther Planet and Thun her thundercolt join King Randy and the Elegant Elephant on their visit to Jinnicky the Red Jinn of the Land of Ev</p><p>Lyman Frank Baum (1856-1919) was born in Chittenango, Ne<p> Lyman Frank Baum (1856-1919) was born in Chittenango, New York.

Four of her finest are set in the seemingly benign villages of Midsomer County. But bucolic charms can mask a multitude of sins, as Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby (played by John Nettles) and his brash assistant, Sergeant Troy, discover. DVD special features include a Midsomer map, a biography of Graham, and cast filmographies. 6 hours 40 min. on 4 DVDs.</p><p>Acorn Media presents a beautifully realized boxed set that brings to life all the ghastliness and arch humor of Caroline Graham's intriguing mystery series. Set 1 includes four episodes: <i>Death's Shadow</i>, <i>Strangler's Wood</i>, <i>Blood Will Out</i>, and <i>Beyond the Grave</i> Each is set in a different village in the quaint but surprisingly lethal Midsomer County, complete with sharp portraits of the love and loathing that small-town life can breed. John Nettles plays Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby with a wry wit, a satisfyingly keen-but-not-supernatural intelligence, and a deep understanding of human nature. Daniel Casey as the much younger Sergeant Troy has a somewhat tougher job, painting his younger policeman's character in shorter bits over the course of the series, but he becomes a most welcome face. The series is beautifully acted and produced and the solutions are satisfying--not a clinker in the bunch. The DVDs include selected cast filmographies, a biography of author Caroline Graham, and a map of Midsomer County. <i>--Ali Davis</i>The cozy villages of Midsomer County reveal their most sinister secrets in these darkly humorous British television mysteries.

Covering the years from 1820 to 1920, the narrative focuses on how members of the Healy family were able to &#34;pass&#34; as white in a society that scorned people of mixed descent.

The novel has been hailed as one of the most striking early examples of postmodernism and has become a famous test case for theories about reading because of the apparent impossibility of deciding between several radically different interpretations. Does the book have two narrators, as it first appears, or one? How much is fantasy and how much is reality? Whose fantasy and whose reality are they? Brian Boyd, Nabokov's biographer and hitherto the foremost proponent of the idea that <i>Pale Fire</i> has one narrator, John Shade, now rejects this position and presents a new and startlingly different solution that will permanently shift the nature of critical debate on the novel. Boyd argues that the book does indeed have two narrators, Shade and Charles Kinbote, but reveals that Kinbote had some strange and highly surprising help in writing his sections. In light of this interpretation<i>, Pale Fire</i> now looks distinctly less postmodern--and more interesting than ever.</p><br><p> In presenting his arguments, Boyd shows how Nabokov designed <i>Pale Fire</i> for readers to make surprising discoveries on a first reading and even more surprising discoveries on subsequent readings by following carefully prepared clues within the novel. Boyd leads the reader step-by-step through the book, gradually revealing the profound relationship between Nabokov's ethics, aesthetics, epistemology, and metaphysics. If Nabokov has generously planned the novel to be accessible on a first reading and yet to incorporate successive vistas of surprise, Boyd argues, it is because he thinks a deep generosity lies behind the inexhaustibility, complexity, and mystery of the world. Boyd also shows how Nabokov's interest in discovery springs in part from his work as a scientist and scholar, and draws comparisons between the processes of readerly and scientific discovery.</p><br><p> This is a profound, provocative, and compelling reinterpretation of one of the greatest novels of the twentieth century.</p></p><p>Brian Boyd has already chronicled the life of Vladimir Nabokov in two superlative volumes, one devoted to the author's silver-age youth in Russia and the other to his American maturity. Now Boyd turns his attention to the great enchanter's trickiest and most unlikely triumph in <i>Nabokov's Pale Fire</i>. With its oddball structure--which shackles an epic poem in heroic couplets to an increasingly loony, enveloping commentary--this 1962 novel has always been a bone of contention among diehard fans. Some consider it less a work of art than a Rube Goldberg contraption, onto which Nabokov has brilliantly bolted his favorite motifs. Others call <i>Pale Fire</i> the author's true masterpiece, and Brian Boyd falls quite emphatically into the latter camp, arguing that the book is no mere satire on literary parasitism: <blockquote> It is a reflection on the whole history of literature, on the shift from romance to realism, from the old kind of hero with whose glory the reader is invited to identify ... to the modern image of everyman as artist, the suburban Shade, in the modest circumstances of the real, coping with courage and self-control, with imagination, curiosity, tenderness, and kindness, with the fact of his mortality and his losses past and still to come. </blockquote> Boyd's study is at once a shrewd and eloquent guidebook to the intricacies of <i>Pale Fire</i> and a revisionist argument as to its meaning. After all, Nabokovians have spent the last three decades feuding over the ultimate authorship of this double-decker narrative: could the poet, John Shade, have created both the poem <i>and</i> commentary? Or should both be chalked up to that nutty exegete Charles Kinbote? As he wades into this factional war, Boyd can sometimes appear only nominally less insane than Kinbote. ("The prominence of the Shadean or Kinbotean or 'undecidable' readings had not gone unchallenged. D. Barton Johnson, attending to verbal and subverbal detail, stood largely outside the Shade-Kinbote opposition when he focused on the Botkin behind Kinbote." Help!) Yet his hypothesis--which involves a ghost feeding lines to the living like a posthumous Teleprompter--makes perfect sense. And it reminds us that for all Nabokov's vaunted irony and scientific passion, he was fascinated throughout his entire career by the afterlife. Volodya as theologian? Boyd is smart and persuasive enough to make the concept stick, and to send every last one of us back to <i>Pale Fire</i>--immediately. <i>--James Marcus</i><p>"No one knows more about Nabokov and his works than Brian Boyd does, and this book is obviously a work of passion. It enlivens our sense of a marvelous novel, it encourages generous close reading, and it makes the best case possible for the general human value of Nabokov's fiendish cleverness."<b>--Michael Wood, Princeton University, author of<i>The Magician's Doubts: Nabokov and the Risks of Fiction</i></b></p><p>"Brian Boyd is Nabokov's ideal, astute, and observant reader, paying attention to every detail which, for Nabokov, was the essence of all writing and all reading. Boyd does so not only intelligently and thoughtfully but also lovingly."<b>--Galya Diment, University of Washington</b></p><p>"This is a remarkable piece of literary detective work. Brian Boyd brings to bear on Nabokov's most elaborately encrypted novel an acute attention to textual detail and a vast fund of relevant learning, coupled with endlessly resourceful ingenuity. The result is a provocative thesis about the structure and meaning of the novel-seemingly a "solution" but, as he himself grants, really grounds for continuing discussion, and in any case, a vivid demonstration of the excitements of skilled reading."<b>--Robert Alter, University of California, Berkeley</b></p></p><h2>Black Sheep One: The Life of Gregory &#34;Pappy&#34; Boyington</h2><p><i>Black Sheep One </i>is the first biography of legendary warrior and World War II hero Gregory Boyington.<i> </i>In 1936, Boyington became an aviation cadet and earned the &#x201c;wings of gold&#x201d; of a naval aviator. After only a short period on active duty, however, he was &#x201c;encouraged&#x201d; to resign from the Marine Corps due to his unconventional behavior. Remarkably, this inauspicious beginning was just the prologue to a heroic career as an American fighter pilot and innovative combat leader. With the onset of World War II, when skilled pilots were in demand, he became the commander of an ad hoc squadron of flying leathernecks. Led by Medal of Honor winner Boyington, the legendary Black Sheep set a blistering pace of aerial victories against the enemy.<br><br>Though many have observed that when the shooting stops, combat heroes typically just fade away, nothing could be further from the truth for Boyington.

Leading a congressionally funded &gt; expedition across the Bitterroot Range of the Rocky Mountains in September &gt; 1805, they became the first known whites to admire the soaring granite &gt; peaks and swift, cold rivers of what would later become the panhandle of &gt; Idaho. It had taken them sixteen months to come this far, and another year &gt; would pass before they returned to their own civilization. Meanwhile, the &gt; Shoshone Indians who guided them through the mountains surely saw the &gt; white men's presence as a sign that more would follow. &gt; &gt; More did, just a trickle, barely noticeable at first. French trappers and &gt; missionaries arrived from Canada, giving their descriptive names to some &gt; of the tribes, the Nez Perce and Coeur d'Alene among them. For years the &gt; hardy trappers and devout reformers were the only newcomers to venture &gt; into the unforgiving mountains, but other settlers were eventually drawn &gt; by the promise of abundant resources and spectacular beauty. Then came the &gt; Civil War, after which the westward expansion mushroomed, precipitated by &gt; the joining of the Union Pacific and Central Pacific railroads in 1869. &gt; The banging home of a ceremonial gold spike completed an engineering feat &gt; that changed the Indians' ways forever--and changed the land. &gt; &gt; From the transcontinental railroad a network of tracks spread across the &gt; West like a crazy web. Adventure seekers, industrialists, and immigrants &gt; looking for the American Dream rode the rails and wagon trails to newly &gt; accessible regions. The seekers surveyed vast regions of timber, found &gt; gold and silver, discovered bonanzas of natural bounty; the industrialists &gt; found ways to exploit these finds and extract the riches from the land. As &gt; the railroads brought more people, the towns grew in proportion, requiring &gt; ever greater quantities of lumber. &gt; &gt; In 1902, a trained timber estimator named Joseph Boyington left his &gt; children in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and moved to the "stovepipe" of Idaho, &gt; not far from the trail blazed by Lewis and Clark. The surrounding &gt; mountains held an enormous belt of white pine, reputedly the largest stand &gt; in the world, providing plenty of opportunity for a "timber cruiser" such &gt; as he. If a landowner wished to sell acreage to a lumber company, &gt; Boyington could determine how much usable timber it held, depending on the &gt; size of trees the company wanted to log. By traversing the property at &gt; specified distances, or "chains," and counting the trees meeting the &gt; desired diameter, he could estimate the total board feet of lumber and &gt; assess its value. &gt; &gt; The lure of opportunity brought Boyington to Dalton Gardens, a peaceful &gt; neighborhood of small farms and apple orchards north of Coeur d'Alene. &gt; Back in Eau Claire, he had farmed and was proprietor of a wholesale feed &gt; and flour business in addition to estimating lumber. A wife named Hannah &gt; had been with him at one time, though for the past fifteen years she had &gt; not been listed as a member of his household. Of his four children, the &gt; three youngest remained in Eau Claire to work or complete their education; &gt; the eldest left for Evanston, Illinois, and enrolled in the school of &gt; dentistry at Northwestern University. &gt; &gt; This was Charles Barker Boyington, born on August 31, 1875. He completed &gt; his schooling in 1897, then clerked in Eau Claire until a bookkeeping job &gt; took him to Montana for a few years. After a visit to Eau Claire, he left &gt; again in 1902 to pursue a doctor of dental science degree. Three years &gt; later--making him nearly thirty--he collected his diploma in a ceremony at &gt; the Garrick Theater on Randolph Street, then left Evanston for the promise &gt; of the West. His destination: Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, a picturesque lakeside &gt; town on the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, just a few miles from &gt; his father's home. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Charles Boyington did not own a horse, buggy, or riding equipment. Thus, &gt; like most people doing business in town, he walked. Setting up his first &gt; practice, he hung his shingle outside an office in the Dollar Block, then &gt; equipped his workplace with the latest furniture, including a fancy dental &gt; cabinet of dark wood. There was an autoclave for sterilizing tools, an &gt; upright telephone with its separate earpiece, a steel cuspidor, and an &gt; elaborate belt-driven hand tool that turned drilling and grinding &gt; attachments. &gt; &gt; Soon after opening the practice, Boyington posed for a photograph beside &gt; his barber-style dentist's chair. His short hair was neatly combed, his &gt; face fully shaven, drawing attention to a long, straight nose and &gt; prominent chin. In this and later photographs he did not smile widely &gt; enough to show his own teeth, though his broad mouth had an amicable turn &gt; at the corners. &gt; &gt; Within a few years his practice was earning a handsome income of about &gt; $300 per month--this during a time when a new three-room house on five &gt; acres outside town could be bought for $500. Charles put his money into &gt; property, purchasing a house on West Foster Avenue, and later mortgaging &gt; two more lots with a dwelling on Eleventh Street. Considering the value of &gt; the properties and the small lien on his expensive dental equipment, he &gt; had already accumulated a respectable net worth. &gt; &gt; Such a successful dentist would have been considered a catch for the &gt; eligible ladies of Coeur d'Alene, but there was the stigma of divorce: &gt; Boyington had been married briefly to heavyset Maude Poore in Montana, a &gt; failed union that produced no children. He maintained a low profile for &gt; several years, then, at the age of thirty-six, applied for a license to &gt; marry Grace Barnhardt Gregory, a twenty-three-year-old with long, dark &gt; tresses who had recently arrived in Coeur d'Alene. If his decision seemed &gt; impulsive to some, at least the age disparity was nothing new; at about &gt; the same time, the county clerk signed a permit for a forty-two-year-old &gt; woman to wed a codger of sixty-eight. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Grace may have simply turned his head. She was full figured, with round &gt; cheeks that dimpled when she flashed a bright smile. She wore her long &gt; hair piled high, in the current style, and was accustomed to fashionable &gt; dresses. &gt; &gt; Her story began in Monticello, a small crossroads in eastern Iowa, where &gt; she was born on January 11, 1888. She was the youngest of six children &gt; raised by burly, mustachioed William Gregory and his wife, Ellen. Grace &gt; was eight when they moved to Mitchell, South Dakota, where William worked &gt; as a road master for the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad. &gt; Misfortune visited the Gregorys in 1901 when fifteen-year-old John was &gt; killed accidentally by gunfire at a local shooting gallery; more turmoil &gt; followed when William junior divorced his wife. Another son, Forrest, died &gt; in 1908 of peritonitis. &gt; &gt; Despite the tragedies, or perhaps because of them, Grace was animated, &gt; cavorting with a large group of friends. The young ladies wore full-length &gt; skirts and high-collared blouses, the young men dressed as dandies. She &gt; was a racy teen, sneaking with friends behind the Corn Palace to smoke and &gt; probably drink. A talented pianist, in her late teens she traveled some &gt; nine hundred miles to enter the music program at a "normal school," the &gt; equivalent of a teachers' college, in Detroit, Michigan. The curriculum at &gt; the Thomas Normal Training School prepared her for a career in music &gt; education, but instead of teaching, she worked in theaters after her 1909 &gt; graduation, providing piano accompaniment to motion pictures before the &gt; advent of the "talkies." &gt; &gt; Evidently she had been hired to play in Coeur d'Alene, either at the Rex &gt; Theater or some saloon, when she met Charles Boyington sometime after &gt; 1910. They appeared at the courthouse for a marriage license on December &gt; 27, 1911, then wasted little time once the union was approved. A &gt; traditional church wedding would have been unsuitable because of Charles's &gt; divorce, so they stood before justice of the peace Roger Wearne, a boarder &gt; at Wolf Lodge. The ceremony was performed on New Year's Day 1912, with &gt; Florence and Fred Tiffany (Grace's sister and brother-in-law) as &gt; witnesses. There is no indication that anyone else attended. &gt; &gt; Charles bought Grace a piano on credit for five dollars a month, and they &gt; lived comfortably on his income, but whatever matrimonial bliss they &gt; enjoyed was brief. Grace was pregnant by early March, after which a &gt; terrible change apparently came over Charles. One night, according to &gt; Grace, Charles shoved her into a corner with his fist, then grabbed both &gt; her wrists and twisted them while calling her "all sorts of vile and &gt; vulgar names." He did not strike her again during the pregnancy, but the &gt; verbal abuse continued, "so often," she claimed, "that it would be almost &gt; impossible for anyone to remember." &gt; &gt; There was little joy for the expectant mother when she reached full term &gt; in early December 1912. Snow covered the ground during the first few days &gt; of the month, followed by rain on the fourth, a Wednesday. The temperature &gt; climbed into the low forties, turning the streets into a quagmire. &gt; Fortunately, Grace did not have to be concerned about whether a midwife or &gt; attendant could reach her on this dreary day; she had a bed at the Coeur &gt; d'Alene Hospital. &gt; &gt; At five o'clock, under the glow of newly installed electric lights, Grace &gt; gave birth to a healthy ten-pound son.

This handsome volume displays the cream of its enormous collection of images from early black-and-white photographs to those produced with today's digital technology. The collection is broken down into natural geographic sections, commencing with North America and ranging continentally through to the polar regions. Each picture has an excellent caption that provides explanation and insight. The photographer's name, the year the picture was taken, and location are included. A sort of super issue of the magazine itself, the book offers a satisfying variety of visual wonders.

A stunning array of photographic history.<br><i>Frances Reiher, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.This beautiful, large-format volume benefits from the quality of National Geographic's exceptional photo archives, though it reflects the oft-noted NG shortcoming of superb visuals burdened by less-than-inspired text. The value here is in the juxtaposition of historic photographs, some in black and white or sepia, with contemporary portraits of similar places and people. These images often portray cultures in transition. The work, lifestyle, dress, and villages depicted in early prints as evidence of "purer" cultures now collide with the global materialism and corporate marketing that seem intent on bringing logo-drenched T-shirts and television to every corner of the world. The book is usefully divided by region: North America, Central and South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Oceania, and the Poles. Its strengths are the technical standard and quality of composition found in virtually every photograph.

She discovered that her patients were not only in need of medical care, but that they urgently had a story to tell, a story suppressed by nationalist politicians and the mainstream media. What Broz heard compelled her to devote herself over the next several years to the collection of firsthand testimonies from the war. These testimonies show that ordinary people can and do resist the murderous ideology of genocide even under the most terrible historical circumstances. We are introduced to Mile Plakalovic, a magnificent humanist, who drove his taxi through the streets of Sarajevo, picking the wounded up off the sidewalk and delivering food and clothing to young and old, even when the bombing was at its worst. We meet Velimir Milosevic, poet, who traveled with an actor and entertained children as they hid in basements to avoid the bombing and gunfire, and we hear the stories of countless others who put themselves in grave danger to help others, regardless of ethnic background.<br> <br> Faced with a world in which unspeakable crimes not only went unpunished but were rewarded with glory, profit, and power, the Bosnians of all faiths who testify in this book were starkly confronted with the limits and possibilities of their own ethical choices. Here, in their own words they describe how people helped one another across ethnic lines and refused the myths promoted by the engineers of genocide. This book refutes the stereotype of inevitable natural enmities in the Balkans and reveals the responsibility of individual actions and political manipulations for the genocide; it is a searing portrait of the experience of war as well as a provocative study of the possibilities of resistance and solidarity. The testimonies reverberate far beyond the frontiers of the former Yugoslavia. This compelling book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the reality on the ground of the ethnic conflicts of the late twentieth and the twenty-first centuries.</p><p><b>Dr. Svetlana Broz</b><br><br>Dr. Svetlana Broz, cardiologist, is currently Director of the NGO Garden of the Righteous in Sarajevo, the President of the Board of The First Children's Embassy in the World and a member of various NGOs, including the Association of Independent Intellectuals CIRCLE 99.

Some commit remarkable acts of heroism and a few place themselves in great danger by reaching out across conflict lines to people in need. The people in this book are ordinary.

The novel sold six and a half million copies in the United States, and introduced Spillane&#39;s most famous character, the hardboiled PI Mike Hammer. The many novels that followed became instant bestsellers, until in 1980 the US all-time fiction bestseller list of fifteen titles boasted seven by Mickey Spillane. More than 225 million copies of his books have sold internationally. He was uniformly disliked by critics, owing to the high content of sex and violence in his books. However, he was later praised by American mystery writers Max Alan Collins and William L. DeAndrea, as well as artist Markus Lupertz.

Though Lacanian theory has long had a privileged place in the analysis of film, film theory has tended to ignore some of Lacan's most important ideas. As a result, Lacanian film theory has never properly integrated the disruptive and troubling aspects of the filmic experience that result from the encounter with the Real that this experience makes possible. Many contemporary theorists emphasize the importance of the encounter with the Real in Lacan's thought, but rarely in discussions of film. By bringing the encounter with the Real into the dialogue of film theory, the contributors to this volume present a new version of Lacan to the world of film studies.<br><br>These essays bring this rediscovered Lacan to bear on contemporary cinema through analysis of a wide variety of films, including <i>Memento</i>, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, <i>Breaking the Waves</i>, and <i>Fight Club</i>. The films discussed here demand a turn to Lacanian theory because they emphasize the disruptive role of the Real and of <i>jouissance</i> in the experience of the human subject. There is a growing number of films in contemporary cinema that speak to film's power to challenge and disturb the complacency of spectators, and the essays in <i>Lacan and Contemporary Film</i> analyze some of these films and bring their power to light.<br><br>Because of its dual focus on developments in Lacanian theory and in contemporary film, this collection serves as both an accessible introduction to current Lacanian film theory and an introduction to the study of contemporary cinema. Each essay provides an accessible, jargon-free analysis of one or more important films, and at the same time, each explains and utilizes key concepts of Lacanian theory. The collection stages an encounter between Lacanian theory and contemporary cinema, and the result is the enrichment of both.</p><p><b>Todd McGowan</b><br><br>Todd McGowan teaches film and critical theory in the English Department at the University of Vermont.

That mechanism of delusion, whatever its form, has continually fascinated thinkers and doers everywhere, although the French seem particularly taken with it. Shortly after the first Gulf War, the notorious Jean Baudrillard -- a guy who takes particular glee in pushing buttons and punching holes in reality -- wrote an audacious book called "The Gulf War Did Not Take Place," which categorized Bush 41's cowboy excursion to save Kuwait as a bloodless media event. That piece of Swiftian scholarship cost him dearly, but his penetrating insights about media and war (and media war, to be specific) seem like prophecy today, as the American military wades through a similar quagmire in the same damn country. <br><br>While Baudrillard's work often touched every base in the stadium, French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's output seemed to stick most capably to film studies. For a time there in the '60s and '70s, if you were studying film, most likely you were doing it through Lacan's prism, because his theories of the self involved a subject struggling to distinguish its own desires from the real world. What made Lacan cool was the fact that he realized that human beings constructed fantasies they convinced themselves were reality, while the material world they occupied resided far outside of their constructions. He might have partially agreed with the popular advertising slogan -- "Perception is reality" -- because so much of his work is built upon misrecognition.<br><br>Or maybe it's that way because, as author Todd McGowan explains, Lacan fully understood how tangled the knot of desire and confusion can become, especially in cinema. "The focus of Lacanian theory on the operations of desire and fantasy make it invaluable for film criticism," McGowan says. "Lacan orients psychoanalysis around the desire of the subject, and he relates all questions -- ethical, religious, aesthetic -- back to this desire. Cinema is also organized around the desire of the subject. As spectators, we choose the films we see because of the way that they promise to mobilize our desire. Lacan understands that this desire is always unconscious -- so that we don't know why we desire what we desire. So Lacanian theory allows us to interpret films in a way that uncovers their unconscious appeal, not just their conscious appeal." <br><br>McGowan and Kunkle's book is doing its best to reclaim film studies for Lacaniacs, and that is a good thing, because film culture is filled to the breaking point with characters continually misrecognizing their personal fantasies for reality. Almost everything Kubrick and Hitchcock made comes to mind (although the latter was partial to Freud), as well as most of film noir and the cinema of Charlie Chaplin. But "Lacan and Contemporary Film," as its title suggests, slaps scores of more recent films -- "Pi," "Memento," "Holy Smoke," "Breaking the Waves," "Eyes Wide Shut" and many more -- beneath Lacan's microscope to see what pops up. <br><br>Even better, these essays keep the jargon to a minimum; the excellent Slavoj Zizek (who helped explode Lacanian film study with "Enjoy Your Symptom: Jacques Lacan in Hollywood and Out") dives right into his critique with barely any setup at all. "Lacan's theories are notoriously -- and even intentionally -- difficult," McGowan added. "All of our contributors, however, are fully committed to presenting Lacan's thought in an accessible manner. This is one reason why each of them has been drawn to the analysis of film. Film allows us to see Lacan's theories in action, to transcend the difficulties of terminology that haunt many readers." <br><br>The result is a collection of brainy film essays that make Michael Medved look like a hack (well, like the hack he is).</p><h2>Brand of the Werewolf / Fear Cay (Doc Savage, Vol. 13)</h2><p>Doc Savage teams up with his beautiful cousin in the Lester Dent novels that introduced the character of Patricia Savage.

Cantor (The Sacred Chain: History of the Jews). In this ground-breaking work, Norman Cantor explains how our current notion of the Middle Ages-with its vivid images of wars, tournaments, plagues, saints and kings, knights and ladies-was born in the twentieth century. The medieval world was not simply excavated through systematic research. It had to be conceptually created: It had to be invented, and this is the story of that invention. - Amazon</p><p>This book is much broader in scope than the title would imply. Part historiography, part biographical sketches, and part personal memoir, it explores the lives of the 20 scholars (19 men and one woman) whom Cantor perceives as "the great medievalists" of the period 1895-1965. His thesis is that Wilsonian idealism, World War II, the Nazi Holocaust, and the Cold War shaped the world views and the interpretations of the European and American scholars studying the Middle Ages. The book is based on Cantor's frequently brilliant, sometimes fanciful (he knew seven personally) analysis of the scholars' works; their obituary notices; and his memory of conversations that took place 40 or more years ago. Strong on the historians (predictably, since Cantor is a historian), respectable on the literary scholars, weak on the art historians, the book contains a mine of information, much of it anecdotal, about those discussed. Bristling with prejudices, judgments (in many cases wrongheaded), and predictions, clever and witty in style, it will command a wide audience in both academia and the informed reading public. For research and general collections. History Book Club selection. -- Bennett D. Hill, George town Univ., Washington, D.C.<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.To 19th-century romantics, the Middle Ages were a justification for aesthetic passion and communal feeling. In contrast, the 20th century's picture of the Middle Ages stresses its synthesis of faith and reason, charismatic leadership of saints and heroes, formalist attitude to art and literature, and ideas of divine and human love. These constructs, argues New York University medievalist Cantor, are the product of such influential medievalists as Frederic Maitland, Erwin Panofsky, C. S. Lewis and Richard Southern. His sometimes provocative study combines intimate profiles of 20 medievalists with an assessment of the impact of their ideas on our image of the Middle Ages. Cantor unravels the "common man's ethos" in J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and discusses Eileen Power's searing indictment of the Middle Ages' marginalization of women. He invents his own Middle Ages: one that tells us to reject the "regulatory and welfare state" and reassert the values of civil society and "tough love." <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Veneer: Living Deeply in a Surface Society</h2><p>Our lives are full of scars, quirks and insecurities we have learned to hide in favor of a more glamorous veneer we hope the world finds more acceptable. This is the modern tragedy. We have forgotten that like the stress-lines and fractures of antique wood, these imperfections in our lives are what make us beautiful.&nbsp;<br> <br> Abundant living is more than a wall-post existence. Rich relationships are more than trends, status updates and group invitations. But neither are possible until we allow ourselves to be fully known, imperfections and all. Only then will we come to experience the life we are meant to live.&nbsp;<br> <br> As authors Tim and Jason explain, the Creator's idea of humanity is quite different from the world's. It is also far more rewarding. This life begins when we dare strip away our veneers and enter a life of freedom, honesty and rare beauty.</p><p>The world has a love affair---with itself. Armed with Facebook, Twitter, and blogs, we think of ourselves as mini celebrities, and we use consumption and technology to convince our friends that this facade is who we are. Veneer illustrates that consumption is more than just acquiring more stuff; it is a potentially dangerous mindset---a mindset turning everything, even people, into products.According to authors Timothy Willard and R. Jason Locy, there is evidence of consumption in all channels of culture---even the church. Most Christian commentators suggest that the church should speak the language of the congregants. Willard and Locy suggest the opposite approach: if congregants are steeped in a culture of consumption, the church should not speak their language at all.Veneer encourages the church to become a refreshing voice amidst a veneered world, inviting you to lead an unveneered life of freedom, honesty, and beauty. Taking on an original concept that addresses the potential dangers of consumption and technology, Veneer speaks to many Christians who are unsure how to live with true meaning among the ever-changing trends and technology our culture offers.Timothy D. Willard has written for publications and organizations such as Catalyst, WinShape Foundation, The Prison Entrepreneurship Program, and Invisible Ink. He is also pursuing an MA in Christian Thought at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He lives with his wife and their daughter, Lyric.<br><br>R.

But she knows Nathan will eventually be called back to serve his queen and Kai will have to decide whether to enter her majesty&#39;s service as well. What seemed to be a quick conclusion turns out to be anything but. The two of them helped thwart the Sidhe god of chaos and he is not happy at all. He&#39;s got plans for them and for the Sidhe who killed him some three millennia ago. He has also kept his revenge plans for Earth, as the pair discover when chaos erupts.</p><p><b>Praise for the Lupi Novels of Eileen Wilks</b> <p></p>"Eileen Wilks writes what I like to read."--Linda Howard, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author <p></p>"As intense as it is sophisticated, a wonderful novel of strange magic."--Lynn Viehl, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of the Darkyn series <p></p>"Grabs you on the first page and never lets go...I really, really loved this book."--Patricia Briggs, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author<b>Eileen Wilks</b> is a<i> USA Today </i>bestselling author, a three-time RITA Award finalist, and the recipient of a Career Achievement Award from <i>Romantic Times</i>.

Santiago captures the grit of Clemente's rise from his impoverished childhood, to the majesty of his performance on the field, to his fundamental decency as a human being, in a drawing style that combines realistic attention to detail and expressive cartooning. <br><br></p><p>Wilfred Santiago was born in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He now lives in Chicago.&#x201c;Santiago uses black and white and some yellow-orange fill-ins, but really that&#x2019;s all he needs. His style is clean, ranging in depiction of Clemente throughout the years to religious leaders to baseball action scenes ... Santiago does Clemente proud with <em>21</em>.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David A. Kirschenbaum, <em>Boog City</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;More than anything, ...<em>21</em> is a book of huge ambition and formal daring. The storytelling is kaleidoscopic... But for all his overt displays of (admittedly dazzling) technique, Santiago never loses track of his story. [...] <em>21: The Story of Roberto Clemente</em> is a mammoth achievement...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jack Feerick, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Santiago... creates a well-balanced, yet striking, portrait of the man and his times. This is a book to be enjoyed by teens and adults, baseball fans, and anyone who wants to read an epic story.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Largehearted Boy</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The world around [Clemente] is alive, and Santiago&#x2019;s expressive (and occasionally, bracingly expressionistic) approach to portraying Clemente&#x2019;s wild athletic genius ensures that it remains thrillingly present.... [A] fitting and vital tribute.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>David Roth, <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Lusciously realised in sumptuous earth-tones and powerfully redolent of the spirit of Unjust Times A-Changin&#x2019;, this is a fabulous book for every fan of the medium and not simply lads and sports-fans.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Win Wiacek, <em>Now Read This!</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It's an artistic tour de force and shows that bio comics do not have to be the stolid, one step at a time narrative that we often see. ...<em>21</em> is an excellent book... Clemente is every bit the important figure in baseball history that Robinson was, and more people need to know his story. <em>21</em> is an excellent place to start, either for you or the baseball fan in your life.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rob McMonigal, <em>Panel Patter</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Wilfred Santiago captures the physical grace of baseball and creates a story of visceral and emotional force... Santiago... has produced a rich and surprising work. The compositions and framing are intricate and varied... Santiago captures Clemente's relentless vitality as a player, frames the story around the historical and religious traditions of Puerto Rico, and handles Clemente's tragic death with restraint, all with a gimlet eye and the sensitivity of a true artist. It is a classic story given new life in this fresh, innovative telling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Alex Belth, <em>Sports Illustrated</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred Review. Nearly every page brings a new compositional marvel... The in-game sequences... are show-stoppers... [F]or a book that matches the pure athleticism, unshakable compassion, and towering legacy of its subject, look no further.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Wilfred Santiago's <em>21</em> is brilliant and beautiful, challenging and lyrical ... which seems exactly right, as Roberto Clemente was all those things and more.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Rob Neyer, <em>ESPN.com</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What Santiago has done is to create a sketch of Clemente&#x2019;s life as he actually led it, not as the legend he became.... Even more impressive is the way Santiago tells this story. His gorgeous illustrations... perfectly capture the period... This is a book to be pored over, not read straight through.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Mark Flowers, <em>School Library Journal</em></strong></p><h2>Marxism and Women&#39;s Liberation</h2><p>For most women, discrimination and oppression are still very much the lived experience today. While much has changed for women, too much has not. Rising sexism and anger about sexual violence have led to an explosion of ideas and activity around the politics of women&#39;s liberation. This book looks at the history and source of women&#39;s oppression and at the struggles to overcome it. Using a clear Marxist framework, it focuses on how best we can achieve real liberation.As austerity bites and new debates about oppression rage, Judith Orr steers a path through the history and future of the fight for women&#39;s liberation, with all its contradictions. Marxism and Women&#39;s Liberation looks at why women are more often to be found on the sticky floor of low pay than above the glass ceiling where the rich reside and the reasons for the assault on the gains of the women&#39;s movement. But more than that, it looks at the forces that have the power to change this and revolutionise women&#39;s lived experience.</p><p></p><h2>The Player of Games (The Culture, Book 2)</h2><p>The Culture &#x2013; a human/machine symbiotic society &#x2013; has thrown up many great Game Players, and one of the greatest is Gurgeh. Jernau Morat Gurgeh. The Player of Games. Master of every board, computer and strategy. Bored with success, Gurgeh travels to the Empure of Azad, cruel and incredibly wealthy, to try their fabulous game...a game so complex, so like life itself, that the winner becomes emperor. Mocked, blackmailed, almost murdered, Gurgeh accepts the game, and with it the challenge of his life &#x2013; and very possibly his death.</p><p>In <i>The Player of Games</i>, Iain M. Banks presents a distant future that could almost be called the end of history. Humanity has filled the galaxy, and thanks to ultra-high technology everyone has everything they want, no one gets sick, and no one dies. It's a playground society of sports, stellar cruises, parties, and festivals. Jernau Gurgeh, a famed master game player, is looking for something more and finds it when he's invited to a game tournament at a small alien empire. Abruptly Banks veers into different territory. The Empire of Azad is exotic, sensual, and vibrant. It has space battle cruisers, a glowing court--all the stuff of good old science fiction--which appears old-fashioned in contrast to Gurgeh's home. At first it's a relief, but further exploration reveals the empire to be depraved and terrifically unjust. Its defects are gross exaggerations of our own, yet they indict us all the same. Clearly Banks is interested in the idea of a future where everyone can be mature and happy. Yet it's interesting to note that in order to give us this compelling adventure story, he has to return to a more traditional setting. Thoughtful science fiction readers will appreciate the cultural comparisons, and fans of big ideas and action will also be rewarded. <i>--Brooks Peck</i>Iain Banks came to controversial public notice with the publication of his first novel, THE WASP FACTORY, in 1984. CONSIDER PHLEBAS, his first science fiction novel, was published under the name Iain M. Banks in 1987. He is now widely acclaimed as one of the most powerful, innovative and exciting writers of his generation.

The index lists every horticultural name published, ensuring that Japanese Maples will continue to be the foremost reference book on this wonderfully versatile collection of ornamental plants. This fully updated third edition has been revised by Peter Gregory and is even more international than its predecessors. It adds approximately 100 important new maple hybrids and selections that have been introduced since the last revision by Vertrees in 1987, bringing to nearly 400 the total number of plants described. Nomenclature has been updated to conform to current standards, many additional photographs have been included, and descriptions have been rearranged for greater ease of reference.</p><p>A comprehensive source of information on the culture, identification, and nomenclature of Japanese maples, this classic bestseller describes each of the 320 cultivars of Acer palmatum and 60 cultivars of other Japanese maple species. This fully updated third edition has been revised by Peter Gregory, chairman of the international Maple Society.This third edition of the classic book on Japanese maples is certain to attract new converts to these superior garden trees. When the first edition of this book by J. D. Vertrees appeared in 1978, there had been no definitive text in English describing them in detail; these trees were the province of specialists only, and few even knew their correct names. Today, Japanese maples are found in nearly every garden center; many new varieties are bred and introduced each year. The inclusion of these new varieties, together with updated information on plant names which renders obsolete some names in the previous editions, makes this new update by Peter Gregory an indispensable reference. With their remarkable diversity of color, form, and texture, Japanese maples are unlike any other kind of garden tree. The shapes and patterns of Japanese maple leaves, in particular, can defy the imagination. Resulting from hundreds of years of careful breeding and observation by Japanese horticulturists and their western counterparts, these maples are aristocratic trees and shrubs destined to be specimen plants in any garden in which they are found. <p>Approximately 100 new cultivated varieties (cultivars) have been added to this edition, resulting in descriptions of more than 400 cultivars in all. With 313 color photographs, this book includes 60 more photos than the previous edition. Modern methods of color reproduction and printing have allowed sharper, more accurate versions of Vertrees&#x2019;s original photos to aid the gardener in identification and selection. </p><p>With comprehensive and practical information on growing Japanese maples well, this book will appeal to gardeners at every level.</p></p><h2>Banjo A to Z: Everything You Need to Play 5-string Banjo in Every Style</h2><p>Play the 5-string banjo in virtually every musical situation now!

There was a jarring note in the general picture of uncouth youth--the unwieldly plaster cast and the crutches.<br>I stopped walking, feeling like a heel--and resenting the poor little wretch even more because she made me feel like a heel.<br>"Sorry, Dee. I was just...I'm sorry. Where's your father? Isn't he meeting us?"<br>Dee shrugged. I gathered that she meant the gesture as a negative reply to my question, but it was hardly necessary. The air-terminal building was emptying rapidly as our fellow passengers from the CairoLuxor plane headed for waiting taxis and buses. There was no one present who corresponded to the picture I had formed of Dee's father--a man of middle age, since Dee admitted to seventeen years, a wealthy man, since he could afford to indulge his daughter in Parisian frocks and a companion-me--to nurse the cast and crutches from New York to Egypt. There was nobody there but just us tourists and the horde of insatiable pedlars, swarming like big black-and-white flies over every chunk of human flesh. An unattractive simile, I had to admit. But I was not in an attractive mood. Ever since we touched down on Egyptian soil my insides had been feeling faintly queasy, and the feeling got worse the farther south we came.<br>I turned back to Dee after my survey of the building to find that her open interest had attracted a particularly insistent crowd of the black-and-white robes.<br>"Scarab, lady, five piasters! Come from king's tomb, bring much luck..."<br>Our own original pedlar had managed to press his wares into Dee's hands. That, as all good pedlars know, is half the battle. Dee grinned, and held the scarab out for my inspection. It was the usual oval, about an inch and a half long. The dull blue-green surface was roughly cut into the stylised beetle shape, and the underside had some crude scratches which were meant to be hieroglyphic writing.<br>"It's a fake," I said-too loudly, too emphatically. With the word the sensation of queasy discomfort that had haunted me coalesced into a stab of almost physical pain.<br>Surprised by my near-shout, Dee stared at me.<br>"What's the matter? You look absolutely green. Sun got you already?"<br>&nbsp;"I guess so...Let's find a taxi before they're all taken. Your father must be meeting us at the hotel."<br>&nbsp;"Okay, okay." She was good-natured, I had to admit that. She handed the scarab back to its reluctant owner and batted her artificial lashes at him. "Sorry, buster. No sale."<br>&nbsp;"Yes, yes, you buy!" The pedlar's voice rose to a heartrending shriek. "Four piasters only! Lady, you buy, you say you buy-"<br>&nbsp;I wasn't thinking. I cut him short with one curt Arabic phrase. It was almost worth the blunder to hear his outraged shriek fade into a gurgle of surprise. Almost.<br>"Hotel Winter Palace," I told the taxi driver, and busied myself easing Dee and her cast into the cab. Mentally I was cursing myself, in both English and Arabic. I hadn't been in Luxor for five minutes and already I had made my first mistake. After all the effort I had gone through to turn myself into just another tourist...<br>As the taxi bumped off down the road in a cloud of dust, I took out my compact. My nose actually did need powdering, but that wasn't what worried me. I needed to reassure myself that my new face looked as different as I meant it to.<br>It wasn't a disguise--nothing so crude as that. It was protective colouring, a frightened animal's defence against predatory enemies. Nature helps the hunted animals, but I had to help myself. I had widened my mouth with lipstick, turned my hazel eyes brown through a careful selection of eye makeup. The most effective change of coloration was the one I had applied to my hair. I couldn't do much about the style; my hair is too thick and curly for any but the simplest of short cuts. But I had been a brunette for twenty-five years, and the new ash-blonde curls looked startling.<br>Forty dollars worth of peroxide, a new lipstick, and a kit labelled "Eye Magic"--that was the new Althea Tomlinson. Probably even that small effort had been unnecessary. After all, none of them had seen me for ten years. I was, as they used to say, "slow to develop." At fifteen my figure had been a neat, uncomplicated 30-30-30; Jake used to say I made my dresses by fitting them around a tree trunk. They wouldn't recognise the shapeless, sloppily dressed tomboy in the blonde young woman wearing a well-tailored blue linen suit which displayed a well-tailored figure.<br>Not that I was vain about my figure. It was just my bread and butter--with no jam on the bread. Modelling sounds like a glamorous occupation, but modelling bathing suits and sweaters for a mail-order catalogue has all the giddy fascination of digging potatoes. It doesn't pay all that well, either--especially when every extra cent is popped into a little envelope marked "vacation." Vacation? Rest, relaxation, change of scene...Admittedly I had indulged in a bit of irony when I labelled that envelope.<br>My thoughts were falling back into the old familiar rut. In an effort to distract them I glanced at Dee, but she seemed to have no need of my ministrations. She was staring out the window, apparently fascinated by the view. The airfield lies in the desert, away from the modern village of Luxor, but our driver was pushing his rattling machine to its limit--a mad, breathtaking thirty-five miles an hour. Over that excuse for a road it felt like sixty. With clashing gears and flapping fenders we roared towards the town, which is right on the Nile, in the middle of the fertile regions which border the river on either bank. Ahead I could see the vivid greens of the fields and the graceful shapes of date palms. The colours were almost dazzling in their intensity after the sun-bleached rock of the desert. Above it all stretched the illimitable sky of Upper Egypt, of a blue so pure and intense that it suggests a rare type of Chinese pottery.<br>I was chagrined to realise that my eyes were blurred, and not by the dust which surrounded our progress. Egypt is not a kindly land. The lush green fields are only thin strips masking the merciless desolation of the desert. But there was something in the clear air and the ruthless sunlight--something that got into one's blood like malaria, a nostalgia no medicine could cure.<br>"...fakes?" said Dee.<br>I jerked as if she had slapped me.<br>"Were all those things the men were selling fakes?" she repeated, sublimely suppressing syntax.<br>There was the cure for my relapse into sentimentality. One key word, functional, operative.<br>"Fakes," I said, trying it out. "Yes. They were all fakes. Most of the fellahin make them. Jolly little home industries. Scarabs, ushabti--those are the statuettes. All fakes, forgeries, imitations ... "<br>The taxi swung in a wide exuberant curve, cutting off my list of synonyms and throwing Dee against me. She straightened up with a muttered word that lifted my eyebrows. Modern teenagers really got a liberal education.<br>At first 1 didn't recognise the hotel. That was good; too many fond old memories had hit me in the last half hour. Since my time the management had added a handsome new section, and it was at the plate-glass doors of this part of the hotel that the taxi stopped. I paid the driver what he asked, which was stupid; everyone in Luxor expects, and enjoys, a good loud argument over prices. But I was afraid that if I started haggling I might forget myself again. A tourist who speaks fluent gutter Arabic is worth mentioning during the evening gossip session. The grapevine works quickly in small towns all over the world.<br>I hadn't realised how hot I was until the air conditioning in the lobby hit me; I felt my whole body sag with sheer delight. It evidently affected Dee the same way, for she dropped heavily into the nearest chair and closed her eyes.<br>"I'm absolutely dead," she announced flatly. "See about things, will you? Dad must be around somewhere."<br>&nbsp;I looked "around," but since I had never seen a photograph of my temporary employer, I didn't expect to find him. Almost any of the lounging male tourists in the lobby might have been my middle-aged, rich Mr. Bloch. It takes money to winter in Egypt, and it takes most men half a lifetime to accumulate that much money.<br>I went to the desk, feeling mildly exasperated with the elusive Mr. Bloch. He was a widower with an only child; one would think he would be hovering, anxious to embrace his darling daughter. However, the desk clerk's response to my question left no doubt that we were expected, and impatiently. There was a flurry of bellboys and buzzers and telephones; and a few minutes later a tall, grizzled man emerged from one of the elevators and came towards me.<br>"Miss Tomlinson?" His voice was a surprise after Dee's nasal New York twang; it was soft, very deep, and held a suspicion of a drawl. At my nod he extended a large, well-manicured hand and gave me a firm grip. His face was pink and closely shaved; it wore an expression of sleepy affability that was attractive. Decidedly I preferred Mr. Bloch to Miss Bloch. It was only reasonable to assume, however, that he preferred her to me, so I led the way to the chair where Dee had collapsed. She looked as if she had fallen asleep. I poked her, and was rewarded by signs of life.<br>"Oh," she said, blinking, "Dad. Hi."<br>Bloch gave her gingerly peck on the cheek. He had the same look I have seen on the faces of other fathers of adolescent females--wary, alert, and apprehensive, the look of a man defusing a live bomb. I found it quite pathetic.<br>Unlike certain of her contemporaries, Dee was at least polite. She allowed her father to take her arm and nodded agreeably as he explained that he hadn't been able to get us rooms near his suite in the new section. The hotel was crowded to the roof.<br>"I'm afraid the old section isn't air-conditioned," he said, eyeing her nervously. "But it gets real cool here at night. And you may find it kind of quaint."<br>We walked through the doors into the older section--and straight into my past.<br>Fifty years ago the Winter Palace must have been the last word in elegance. Ten years ago I had fallen in love with its <i>fin-de-si�cle</i> graciousness, its wide central staircase with the gilt balustrades, its music room with the red plush chairs. We always spent a night or two in the hotel before settling down for the winter in the efficient but dreary quarters at the Institute. We couldn't really afford it, but that was one of the ways in which Jake differed from the usual penny-pinching archaeologist. We did things first and worried about whether we could pay for them later. Actually, Jake never did worry much about saving money. Sometimes, as I got older, I lectured him about it, but it was hard to be stern with Jake; he had a way of dismissing criticism with a quirk of his eyebrows and a hilarious comment. I used to wonder whether my mother could have handled him better, but that was one subject we never discussed--the one subject that drove all traces of humour from Jake's face and voice. It had been hard for him, being left with an infant daughter and a memory--just one of those rare, one percent casualties in a medical category which is statistically safer than driving a car. I had no memories of loss myself, but I was always conscious, I suppose, of trying to fill a gap. In the minor, superficial aspects, I succeeded. Jake and I had fun together, more in the manner of contemporaries than as father and daughter. Certainly not like this dreary child and her worried dad...<br>The rooms had shrunk and become shabbier. But my bed looked just like the one I remembered from my last visit, so high I had to use a chair to climb into it, enveloped in a great white cloud of mosquito netting that were gathered into a magnificent lace-frilled crown above the pillow. The first time I climbed into one of those beds I felt like a royal bride.<br>I offered, in duty bound, to help Dee get settled, but Mr. Bloch said he would take care of that himself. He wanted to have a long-chat with his baby. The nice man also told me that he intended to pay for my room--I had been so good to his little girl. Dee and I both came close to choking at that one. I had been barely civil to the child, and she, I knew, considered me the dullest prig since Queen Victoria.<br>Of course I thanked Mr. Bloch. Then he thanked me; and Dee--nudged--thanked me, and I probably would have thanked Dee, for heaven knows what, if Mr. Bloch hadn't gathered his daughter together and removed her, leaving me alone--with my memories.<br>I have had better company.<br>I don't know how long I would have stood there in the middle of the room, as animated as a stone column, if something hadn't happened to jar me out of my trance and remind me of another friendly old Egyptian custom which had slipped my mind.<br>The door flew open, hitting the wall with a bang that sounded like a pistol shot. It was only the chambermaid, bringing fresh towels, but it might just as well have been a waiter or a bellboy. Knocking on doors is not a Luxor custom, nor is locking those same doors. When people go out they lock the doors of their rooms, but during the day it is imperative to have the door not only unlocked but ajar, in order to cultivate a cross-breeze. Luxor's climate is that of the desert--cool at night, hot during the day.<br>I took the towels, and a shower, locking the door before the second operation. Then I called Room Service and ordered tea sent up. I unlocked the door--the waiter would have been terribly hurt if I hadn't--and went out on the balcony, which had a round iron table and two wicker chairs. I hadn't meant to sit down. But it was impossible to glance briefly at that view and leave it.<br>The hotel is on the east bank of the river, along with the modern village and the ancient temple ruins of Karnak and Luxor.

In this collection of 26 humorous essaysAmany of which have appeared in the AdvocateAVilanch takes aim at the Academy Awards, Donny and Marie Osmond and the Super Bowl. He is a crack shot with these easy targetsAas a writer for an Osmond special, he considered it a "personal triumph" when he had Marie sing "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"Abut too often the pieces resemble occasional journalism rather than anything substantial. An interview with Robin Williams while walking around the Castro, San Francisco's gay mecca, raises a few smiles that evaporate quickly. Vilanch is more interesting when he uses humor to address more serious issues: his meditation on why Lana Turner died the same day Hugh Grant was arrested for picking up a working girl is smart and savvy, and his remembrance of actress Elizabeth Montgomery's life and career is moving. His essays on the lack of gay representation in movies (which makes witty use of the Titanic) and the importance of gay pride are also intriguing. But Vilanch has trouble reconciling his funny and serious sides in print, and these pieces, while the most ambitious in the collection, show both his talents and his limitations.

She lives with her family in California.</p>PreSchool-Grade 2-- One Halloween night, a lonely little old lady searches for a bone to add to her vegetable soup. Finding none inside, she goes out to dig and unearths an entire skeleton. After chasing the woman up a tree, the skeleton goes into the house and discovers the soup. It in turn is frightened and is chased by a dog, and finally hides under the bed. After cornering the skeleton, the dog is revealed to be none other than the little old lady herself--dressed in her Halloween costume. The two make a pact not to frighten one another. Then, after sharing the soup and each other's company, they venture out together to "scare somebody," since it is, after all, Halloween night. Johnston's text has the easy cadence of a folktale, making it a good choice for reading aloud. Tomes's familiar gouache paintings reinforce the whimsical quality of the original tale. Even a casual observer will notice the visual clues throughout the pages. A palette of soft muddy browns and grays, with accents of orange, red, and green, creates the ambience of a late October evening. While any promise of a spooky, spine-tingling tale fades early on, this is nevertheless satisfying: a good choice for Halloween story hours and a foil for more sensational yarns. --Corinne Camarata, Port Washington Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The World War II Desk Reference</h2><p><p>More than 12 million American men and women entered the U.S. armed forces during World War II, and millions more worked and sacrificed at home to help the Allied cause to defeat the Axis powers. At the close of the war, America had become the leading nation on the global stage, and its veterans returned home to forge a vibrant postwar society. Written under the direction of two distinguished historians, <em>The World War II Desk Reference</em> explains in clear prose, backed by rosters of statistics, time lines, and maps, the global cataclysm that was World War II.</p><p>But this volume is not a typical almanac. With material ranging from battlefronts to important military commanders to armaments, among the backdrop of all the necessary political, social, and economic factors, Douglas Brinkley and Michael E. Haskew's reference will prove invaluable to readers. Photographs, lists, time lines, tables, glossaries, and maps encapsulate many pieces of complicated information, making <em>The World War II Desk Reference</em> immensely browsable. The book also includes a helpful resource on national World War II monuments, organizations, and museums.</p><p>Throughout the book, you'll find oral histories culled from several sources, including the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the University of New Orleans, which holds the world's largest repository of valuable letters, journals, and other war-related records. Excerpted from those who fought on both sides, these accounts add a deeply touching, profoundly personal dimension seldom found in other books on World War II.</p><p>In a modern world plagued by terrorism, dictators, and weapons of mass destruction, Brinkley and Haskew's seminal work reminds us that America's role in World War II led to a truly monumental victory. For World War II enthusiasts, history buffs, and anyone interested in our nation's history, this is the one book to own.</p></p><p>An incredibly comprehensive and extraordinarily accessible reference for anyone with any interest in World War II facts and profiles.

Lovingly tucked up on her winterized sun porch, Tess marshals her forces--doting artist boyfriend Crow, best friend Whitney Talbot, middle-aged assistant gumshoe Mrs. Blossom, and researcher Dorie Starnes--to probe the disappearance of a chic blonde green-raincoated dog walker she&#39;d been watching from her comfy prison. Tess also takes in the missing woman&#39;s abandoned green-slickered Italian greyhound from hell, a miniature canine terrorist whose anti-housebreaking vendetta offers comic relief from Tess&#39;s threatened pre-eclampsia, her obsessive unraveling of a complex scam, and her last-trimester spats with Crow about their future.

He glanced at the clock and swore as the phone rang again. Who the hell would be calling this time of the night?<br><br>He considered ignoring it, thinking it had to be his boss, although he couldn't imagine why Roger Collins would be calling him. The last time they'd talked he'd told Collins what he thought of his latest sting operation.<br><br>"We had our reasons for what we did," his boss said.<br><br>"You got Ace killed and for what?" TD had demanded. "That whole operation was nothing but a setup. Were you trying to get the two of us killed?"<br><br>"Don't be ridiculous," Collins had shot back.<br><br>But TD couldn't help the feeling that he'd hit too close to home. Something had been very wrong with that entire assignment.<br><br>"Take some time off," his boss had said, getting to his feet and dismissing not only TD&#x2014;but his concerns, as well. "Time to heal, relax, rethink things."<br><br>Rethink things? "Don't you mean quit asking questions? Quit voicing my suspicions?"<br><br>"I mean <em>heal," </em>Collins said. "Even if you hadn't been wounded during the operation, you're not ready mentally to be on the job. Take a vacation. Go somewhere warm. Get some sun. We'll talk in a few more weeks."<br><br><em>Get some sun. </em>Yeah, right. The truth was TD wasn't sure he'd have a job in a few weeks. And even if he did, he wasn't sure he trusted Roger Collins anymore. This wasn't the first time that he'd wondered about some of the covert operations he'd been sent on&#x2014;or about Roger Collins.<br><br>TD couldn't shake the feeling that neither he nor Ace had been expected to come out of the last one alive. Was that because Ace, too, had been questioning Roger's leadership?<br><br><em>That's just guilt talking, </em>he thought as he reached for the phone. He'd gotten an agent killed. He should have checked the man on the ground for a pulse. Instead he'd given him a perfunctory nudge with his boot toe, his mind on the man getting away with what he'd believed was half a million dollars of federal money.<br><br>"Waters," he said into the phone out of habit.<br><br>Silence. No, not silence. He could make out what sounded like wind in the background, a strange static on the line as if the call was coming from some place in the sticks.<br><br>The static reminded him of a sound he hadn't heard since he was eight&#x2014;that eerie howl the wind made as it whipped across the eaves of an old farmhouse in the middle of nowhere.<br><br>"Hello?" he said, unable to keep the sharp edge of anxiety out of his voice.<br><br>"I'm not sure I have the right number. Were you born on May 22, 1983?" asked a clearly disguised voice. With that and the static on the line, he couldn't be sure if it was a man or a woman.<br><br>"Who is this?" he demanded as he sat up ignoring the sudden pain in his side.<br><br>"A friend."<br><br>"I doubt that."<br><br>"I have some information for you."<br><br>TD sat up straighter. "What kind of information?"<br><br>"Information about who you really are."<br><br>What? If this was some kind of joke, he was in no mood for it. He glanced toward his weapon lying within reach. He knew who he was, but apparently the caller didn't. "I don't have the time or patience for this."<br><br>He started to hang up when the voice on the other end of the line said, "I will give you information about your birth parents if you're interested."<br><br>His <em>birth </em>parents? Boy, did this guy have the wrong number. "What's in it for you?"<br><br>A slight hesitation on the other end of the line, then, "Fifty thousand dollars."<br><br>Now he knew the call had been a mistake. If his caller knew anything about him, then he would know better than to try to extort money from him.<br><br>"I know all about your home birth, the adoption and why you were given up. What's that worth to you?"<br><br>TD was shaking his head. The caller should have done his homework. He'd gotten the wrong man in more ways than one. "Sorry, but I wasn't adopted."<br><br>A dry, rattling chuckle. "Whoever told you those people who raised you in that farmhouse outside of Whitehorse, Montana, were your real parents lied to you. I don't know why they were murdered, but I have a feeling you do."<br><br>He felt an odd prickle at the nape of his neck. The caller knew about the farmhouse outside Whitehorse? Knew about the murder? Collins had said he'd taken care of the past, that nothing from it would ever lead the killers to TD.<br><br>"What exactly do I get for my money?" he asked, playing along as the blood-splattered satchel full of bundled cut newspaper flashed in his mind.<br><br>"I told you, I tell you who handled the under-the-radar adoption, I tell you who your parents really are and then you can find out why they were killed. We both know you are more than capable of finding that out on your own."<br><br>TD's heart was pounding. "How do I get the money to you?"<br><br>"I'll give you a mailing address." The caller rattled off a box number in Whitehorse. "Once I have the money, I'll call you with what you need to know. I advise you to move quickly. I'm not the only one who knows who you really are. Your life is in danger. The sooner you know the truth, the better off you will be." <em>Click.</em><br><br>TD sat holding the phone, his heart slamming against his rib cage. <em>What the hell?</em><br><br>Grabbing his gun from the bedside table, he moved to pull back the drapes at his apartment window and look down on the deserted street. Nothing moved. No sign of life and yet he couldn't help the paranoia.<br><br><em>I'm going to help you disappear. </em>Isn't that what his now boss Roger Collins had told him that day as the car he was riding in raced away from the burning farmhouse? <em>We can't let whoever killed your parents find out you're still alive.</em><br><br>But had Roger Collins been protecting TD or the agency? Or himself?<br><br>TD had a feeling that Roger Collins would do anything to protect his position with the agency. He'd said his climb to the top had been hard. How many people had he sacrificed to get there?<br><br>TD felt the room suddenly go cold. Someone knew who he was. That is, who he had been.<br><br>He checked the call that had come in, surprised that it wasn't blocked. Whoever had called wasn't a pro. Far from it.<br><br>Jotting down the unfamiliar number, he dug out the phone book and looked up the area code. His pulse jumped. Montana?<br><br>Hurriedly, he dialed the number. The line began to ring. It rang twice more before what sounded like an old woman answered.<br><br>"Winchester Ranch."<br><br>"Someone just called me from there."<br><br>"Well, it wasn't me," she snapped. "It's after midnight. Call back tomorrow."<br><br>"Wait! Who else is there who might have called me?"<br><br>"How should I know? They come and go around here like it's a damned bus station. I'm just the housekeeper and cook. No one tells me anything."<br><br>He was afraid she would hang up. "Just tell me this. What's your nearest town?"<br><br>"Whitehorse." She did hang up, slamming down the phone.<br><br>He winced and started to call back, but stopped himself. Back at the apartment window, he studied the quiet Atlanta street again. He tried to stay calm, to think rationally.<br><br>Swearing, he closed the drapes. He'd been told all record of his life before the age of eight had been erased to protect him. Unless he wanted to end up like his parents, Collins had told him, he should forget the past. What was there in his past that even Collins didn't want him to know?<br><br>TD closed his eyes, seeing himself at eight, turning around in the back seat of the large, dark SUV as it raced away from the burning farmhouse. Inside the house were his slain parents. At least the people he had believed were his parents.<br><br>Doubt pierced through his memory, exposing what he hadn't questioned at eight, but couldn't ignore now. His parents had lived an isolated life outside of White-horse, Montana, in the middle of nowhere. His mother had homeschooled him. They didn't seem to have any relatives, or friends for that matter. And both had been killed&#x2014;execution style, he now realized.<br><br>"Better to let the killers believe you died in that fire as well as your parents," he'd been told as he was hustled out to the waiting car. "Don't worry. Someone is taking care of everything,"<br><br>That person was waiting in the car. Roger Collins. As head of a secret government agency, Collins had seen that TD was issued a new birth certificate and given a new identity. Thomas Daniel Waters was born that day. Collins had even found people to take care of him until he was old enough to be on his own, friends of his, Collins had said.<br><br>Yes, Collins had taken care of everything, from that day at the farmhouse through college graduation and a job with his exclusive covert agency.<br><br>TD raked a hand through his hair. The stitches in his side hurt like hell. But that was nothing compared to the doubts surging through him. If Collins had taken care of everything, then why was someone calling him from Winchester Ranch near Whitehorse, Montana, saying they knew even more about him?<br><br>The caller had known his real birth date: May 22, 1983. Not the one Collins had given him: June 5, 1983. The caller had also known about the farmhouse and the deaths of his parents.<br><br>Hell, the caller seemed to know more about him than he did himself. Even TD didn't know exactly where he'd been born.<br><br>He shook his head, trying to clear out the doubts. But they had stuck. His parents had been older, neither had resembled him and he'd never really known what his father did for a living. Whatever it was, it had brought Roger Collins into his life that horrible day when he was eight.<br><br>His father must have worked for Collins. That was the only thing that made any sense now. Why hadn't he realized that before? What if the caller was right and the Clarksons weren't his biological parents?<br><br>TD couldn't believe the route his thoughts were taking. Was he really going to believe the word of some anonymous caller in the middle of the night? He pulled out an untraceable cell phone and made the call to the number he'd been given for emergencies only.<br><br>"You have a leak. Someone knows who I am," he said without preamble.<br><br>Hesitation, then Collins said, "That's not possible."<br><br>"I just got a call. The person seems to know more about me than even I do. You said my past was erased and that not even you knew the truth. Well, someone sure as hell does."<br><br>The silence this time had a weight to it. "Sit tight. I'll have someone there in twenty minutes," Collins said.<br><br>TD hung up and looked around his small apartment. From the time he was a boy, he'd relied on his instincts. Those instincts told him he was now on his own. At eight, he'd believed the people who had killed his parents would be looking for him. Why else give him a new identity? Why else would Roger Collins treat him like his own son, get him raised and educated, and bring him into the agency?<br><br>Now TD couldn't be sure who he really had to fear. He thought of Ace and the botched job. Ten minutes later he was packed up and gone. He'd always traveled light, knowing he might have to disappear at any moment.<br><br>By the time the sun came up, he was driving a pickup he'd paid cash for and was on his way to the Winchester Ranch somewhere near Whitehorse, Montana.<br><br>He'd tried to cover his tracks, but he knew Collins and the resources he had available to him. It was just a matter of time before he would have to deal with whoever Collins sent after him.<br><br>Roger Collins called in two of his men to bring in TD Waters. He thought about sending a couple more. Waters wouldn't want to come in. Waters had been getting suspicious for some time now. He was a danger to the agency, a danger to himself. He was especially a danger to Roger Collins. What would he do now?<br><br>Collins hated to think. He'd told the two men he'd sent to use force if necessary. He swore at the thought of how much force it would take to bring Waters in. He should have sent more men.<br><br>Thirty minutes later, he was startled out of his thoughts when his phone rang. He snatched it up. "Did you get him? "<br><br>"He was long gone when we got here," the agent told him. "The way the place was cleaned out, I'd say he isn't planning on coming back."<br><br>Collins swore.<br><br>"He couldn't be that far ahead of us," the agent said. "We can shut down the city. He won't be able to get out."<br><br>"No." That was the last thing Collins wanted, to alert another law-enforcement agency, let alone try to shut down the city to find him. TD was too smart for that, anyway. He would have gotten rid of the big black SUV he drove courtesy of the government.<br><br>"Come back in," Collins said. "I'll take care of it."<br><br>He sat for a moment after he hung up. This couldn't have happened at a worse time. First the debacle with TD's last assignment, and now some anonymous phone call in the middle of the night.<br><br>There was no reason to panic, Collins assured himself. He knew where Waters was headed. Montana. If Waters was going after the caller, then he must have some idea where the call had come from.<br><br>Within minutes Collins had Waters's phone records and the number&#x2014;and where the call had come from: Winchester Ranch. He smiled. This was going to be too easy, since right next door to that ranch, so to speak, was the McCormick Ranch.<br><br>True, it would have to be handled with the utmost of care&#x2014;and not by just anyone. He needed someone he could depend on, someone who wouldn't question any order he gave, someone who knew his way around Montana.<br><br>It would have to be a new recruit, someone who had proven himself but was new enough that TD Waters didn't know the person and wouldn't suspect him. Someone who could get close to TD, watch him and at first, simply report back. But definitely someone loyal who, when it became necessary, would make sure TD Waters never left Montana alive.<br><br>Still smiling, Collins picked up the phone and dialed. "I'm sorry to bother you in the middle of the night, Elizabeth, but I have an assignment for you that can't wait."<br><br><em>Twelve hours later</em><br><br>"Lizzy?" Anne McCormick looked shocked to see her. "What are you doing here?"<br><br>Elizabeth "Lizzy" Calder hadn't known what kind of reception she would get at the McCormick Ranch this close to Christmas&#x2014;especially showing up unannounced. Fortunately she had the perfect excuse&#x2014;she was here to see her childhood friend.<br><br></p><h2>Natural Remedies</h2><p>This valuable volume thoroughly discuses the causes, natural treatment, and prevention of over 50 common complaints all listed in alphabetical order.</p><p></p><h2>Justice Society of America: Black Adam &amp; Isis HC</h2><p>The new Justice Society regroups just in time to face one of their greatest and most personal enemies - Black Adam!

That all leads to an all-new two-parter by classic creator Jerry Ordway as a villain from the JSA&#39;s WWII days returns!</p><p>Geoff Johns has written scores of comics including Infinite Crisis, Green Lantern, All Star Batgirl, Teen Titans, X-Men, The Avengers, The Flash, 52, JSA and Superman. Jerry Ordway has worked on Superman: The Man of Steel and Planetary/Batman. Dale Eaglesham has pencilled Green Lantern and the Batman: No Man&#39;s Land, as well as the smash-hit Villains United.Grade 6 Up&#x2014;The subtitle of this collection is somewhat misleading as only the first half of the book involves the titular characters. It is a transitional volume of sorts, marking the end of Johns's celebrated 26-issue run with an exciting conclusion to a Shazam family crisis. Ordway's short, two-issue story that follows serves as little more than filler, as Bill Willingham (of <i>Fables</i> fame) would take over in issue 29, continuing as the book's writer to the present. <i>Black Adam</i> is also misleading in its indication that it is a self-contained story arc, when it is actually the fifth volume of the current incarnation of <i>Justice Society</i>. Considering Johns's reputation, it's important to have the previous four volumes in the series for the sake of continuity. While perhaps not as central a series to the DC Universe as the "Batman" or "Green Lantern" titles, JSA has a rich cast of unique, often underrated superheroes&#x2014;and with a capable writer like Johns at the helm, the series gives even the most well-known characters' books a serious run for their money.&#x2014;<i>Jason M.

While O'Hare and Flatley were instrumental in making the "weave" a success, Thach was its theoretical innovator, and his use of the tactic in combat at Midway documented its practical application. This portrait of the famous pilot provides a memorable account of how Thach, convinced that his Wildcat was no match for Japan's formidable Zero, found a way to give his squadron a fighting chance. Using matchsticks on his kitchen table, he devised a solution that came to be called the Thach Weave. But as Steve Ewing is quick to point out, this was not Thach's sole contribution to the Navy. Throughout his forty-year career, Thach provided answers to multiple challenges facing the Navy, and his ideas were implemented service wide. <p>A highly decorated ace, Thach was an early test pilot, a creative task force operations officer in the last year of World War II, and an outstanding carrier commander in the Korean War. During the Cold War, he contributed to advances in antisubmarine warfare. This biography shows him to be a charismatic leader interested in everyone around him, regardless of rank or status. His dry sense of humor and constant smile attracted people from all walks of life, and he was a popular figure in Hollywood. Thach remains a hero among naval aviators, his most famous combat tactic still used by today's pilots. 384 pages. 30 photographs. 5 line drawings.

The authors&#39; accompanying history of both societal and psychiatric standards for women reveals the degree to which the prevailing societal conventions could reinforce the perception that these women were &#34;mad&#34;.</p><p>Twenty-six firsthand accounts that tell the terrifying history of women placed in psychiatric institutions, most often against their will, revealing the realities of their lives in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.I had been an inmate of the asylum about nine months, and....walking down the hall to my room, opened the door, and there stood my husband. I think, for a moment or so, I never was so happy. It was his first visit to me....So he took the chair I offered him, drew it closely up to mine, and gazing into my eyes, said: &#34;Were you insane when you were married?&#34; Not one single, little word of kindness or gesture of tenderness, not the shadow of a greeting; simply this cruel, calculating question. Evidently, he had even then formed the determination that I should never leave that asylum alive. I did not then think this, however, and answered, more assuredly, &#34;I was not insane when we were married.&#34; I have changed my opinion since then, materially, and willingly admit I was insane, and my most pronounced symptom was that I married him.</p><h2>Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic Histories and the Date of the Pentateuch (The Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies, 433)</h2><p>Berossus and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus proposes a provocative new theory regarding the date and circumstances of the composition of the Pentateuch. Gmirkin argues that the Hebrew Pentateuch was composed in its entirety about 273-272 BCE by Jewish scholars at Alexandria that later traditions credited with the Septuagint translation of the Pentateuch into Greek. The primary evidence is literary dependence of Gen. 1-11 on Berossus&#39; Babyloniaca (278 BCE) and of the Exodus story on Manetho&#39;s Aegyptiaca (c. 285-280 BCE), and the geo-political data contained in the Table of Nations. A number of indications point to a provenance of Alexandria, Egypt for at least some portions of the Pentateuch. That the Pentateuch, drawing on literary sources found at the Great Library of Alexandria, was composed at almost the same date as the Septuagint translation, provides compelling evidence for some level of communication and collaboration between the authors of the Pentateuch and the Septuagint scholars at Alexandria&#39;s Museum. The late date of the Pentateuch, as demonstrated by literary dependence on Berossus and Manetho, has two important consequences: the definitive overthrow of the chronological framework of the Documentary Hypothesis, and a late, 3rd century BCE date for major portions of the Hebrew Bible which show literary dependence on the Pentateuch.</p><p><p>Andrew Mein is Tutor in Old Testament, Westcott House, Cambridge.</p><br><br>Claudia V.

Silverhair and her kind have lived here from the earliest Rememberings, when Kilukpuk's children first parted some for the jungle, some into the sea, and some into the rock and ice. </p><p> Hear their song! For they are the last of the woolly mammoths, the great, shaggy gentle ones whose bones have greened Earth's grasses through the Long Years, for fifty million springs. Hear their story. </p><p> Silverhair is filled with the dreams of youth, and the warmth of Lop-ear's child growing in her belly. But even as her life begins, her world is ending around her. A new menace, more vicious than wolf or bear, is descending upon the snowlands--a two-legged creature that kills for joy, and fouls the Earth for greed. Silverhair and the matriarch, Owlheart, must escape across the glacial torrents, beyond the saw-toothed mountains. They seek help and find it in unexpected sources, including the distant cousins who long ago found their destiny in the green arms of the sea, and from an enemy: an ice-faced menace known as...the Lost.</p><p> Stephen Baxter, one of today's most acclaimed writers of science fiction and fantasy, now turns his celebrated talents to a tale that has never before been told or even imagined. <em>Silverhair</em> begins a three-part saga--at once thrilling, heartwarming, and tragic--of a small band of mammoth survivors on a remote arctic island, and what happens when they are discovered by a clever and unpredictable animal they call the Lost. </p><p><em> Silverhair</em> is a story for every age, a tale to remember as long as the footfalls of the great and gentle ones still echo in the shadow of the glaciers--forever.</p></p><p><p>Stephen Baxter is an acclaimed, multiple-award-winning author whose many books include the Xeelee Sequence series, the Time Odyssey trilogy (written with Arthur C. Clarke), and <em>The Time Ships</em>, a sequel to H. G. Wells's classic <em>The Time Machine</em>. He lives in England.</p><b>The Story of the Hotbloods</b>The first Cycle story of all (Silverhair told Icebones, her calf)--the very first of all--is of long, long ago, when there were no mammoths.<p>In fact, there were no wolves or birds or seals or bears.</p><p>For the world belonged to the Reptiles.</p><p>Now, the Reptiles were the greatest beasts ever seen--so huge they made the Earth itself shake with their footfalls--and they were cunning and savage hunters.</p><p>But they didn't have things all their own way.</p><p>Our ancestors called themselves the Hotbloods.</p><p>The Hotbloods were small, timid creatures who lived underground, in burrows, the way lemmings do. The ancestors of every warm-blood creature you see today lived in those cramped dens: bear with seal, wolf with mammoth. They had huge, frightened eyes, for they would emerge from their burrows only at night, when the Reptiles were less active and less able to hunt them. They all looked alike, and rarely even argued, for their world was dominated by the constant threat of the Reptiles.</p><p>That was the way the world had been for ten thousand Great-Years.</p><p>It was into this world that Kilukpuk, the first of all Matriarchs, was born. If you could have seen her, small and cautious like the rest, you would never have imagined the mighty races that would one day spring from her loins. But despite her smallness, Kilukpuk was destined to become the mother of us all.</p><p>Now, Kilukpuk had a brother, called Aglu. He was hard-eyed and selfish, and was often accused of hiding when foraging parties were being readied, and of stealing others' food--even stealing from infants. But Aglu was sly, and nothing was ever proven.</p><p>Despite his faults, Kilukpuk loved her brother. She defended him from attack, and did not complain when he took the warmest place in the burrow, or stole her food, for she always dreamed he would learn the error of his ways.</p><p>Now, there came a time when a great light appeared in the night sky.</p><p>It was a ball of gray-white, and it had a huge, hairy tail that streamed away from the sun. The light was beautiful, but it was deadly, for it turned night to day, and made it easy for the Reptiles to pick off the foraging Hotbloods. Great was the mourning in the burrows.</p><p>One night Kilukpuk was out alone, digging in a mound of Reptile dung for undigested nuts--when suddenly . . . </p><p>Well, Kilukpuk never knew what happened, and I don't suppose any of us will.</p><p>The Earth trembled. There was a great glow, as if dawn were approaching--but the glow was in the west, not the east. Clouds boiled across the sky.</p><p>Then the sky itself started to burn, and a great hail of shooting stars poured down toward the land, coming from the west.</p><p>Kilukpuk felt a new shaking of the ground. Silhouetted against the red fire-glow of the west, she saw Reptiles: thousands, millions of them--and they were running.</p><p>The Reptiles had ruled the world as gods. But now they were fleeing in panic.</p><p>Kilukpuk ran back to her burrow, convinced that if even the gods were so afraid, she, and her Family, were sure to die.</p><p>The days that followed were filled with strangeness and terror.</p><p>A great heat swept over the land.</p><p>Then a rain began, salty and heavy, so powerful it was as if an ocean was emptying itself over their heads.</p><p>And then the clouds came, and snow fell even at the height of summer.</p><p>Kilukpuk and her Family, starved and thirsty, thought this was the end of all things. But their burrows protected the Hotbloods, while the creatures of the surface perished.</p><p>At last the cold abated, and day and night returned to the world.</p><p>No Reptiles came. There were no footfalls, no digging claws, no bellows of frustrated hunters.</p><p>At last, one night, Kilukpuk and Aglu led a party to the surface.</p><p>They found a world that was all but destroyed. The trees and bushes had been smashed down by winds and burned by fire.</p><p>There were no Reptiles, anywhere.</p><p>But the Hotbloods found food to eat in the ruined world, for they were used to living off scraps anyhow. There were roots, and bark that wasn't too badly burned, and the first green shoots of recovering plants.</p><p>Soon the Hotbloods grew fat, and, without the ground-rattling footfalls of the Reptiles to disturb them, began to sleep well during the long, hot days of that strange time.</p><p>But there came a time when some Hotbloods did not return from the nightly foraging expeditions, just as it had been before. And then, one day, Kilukpuk was wakened from a dreamless sleep by a slam-slam-slam that shook dirt from the roofs of the burrows.</p><p>Aglu, her brother, came running through the burrows. "It is the Reptiles! They have returned!"</p><p>Kilukpuk gathered her calves to her. They were terrified and bewildered.</p><p>After that, things rapidly got worse. More foragers were lost on the surface. The Hotbloods became as fearful and hollow-eyed as they had ever been, and food soon began to run short in the burrows.</p><p>But Kilukpuk could not help but notice that not all the Hotbloods were suffering so. While the others were skinny and raddled by disease, Aglu and his band of companions seemed sleek and healthy. Kilukpuk grew suspicious, though her suspicion saddened her, for she still loved her brother deeply.</p><p>At last, one night, she followed Aglu and his companions to the surface. She saw that Aglu and the others made little effort to conceal themselves--in fact, they laughed and cavorted in the Moonlight.</p><p>Then they did a very strange thing.</p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>Mind Fist: The Asian Art Of The Ninja Masters</h2><p>Inside every human being is a "sleeping tiger"--a raw, untapped power that once harnessed, can repel aggressors of any kind. . . <br><br> In this masterful book, Dr. Haha Lung draws on the psychological origins of ancient Chinese philosophies, explores the fist fighting traditions of Chinese Kung-fu from its birth in ancient India and introduces the extraordinary concept of the Mind Fist--the mental punch you never see coming! <br><br> Ranging from nonviolent counterattacks to multiple devastating martial arts techniques, this book includes:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Mental and physical exercises to strengthen the mind and body<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Secrets of moshuh-nanren, the Chinese ninja!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Understanding the ways of bullies and aggressors<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;How to prevent violence using Zhenkin, the Art of Control<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Three kinds of force with which you can win physical battle<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;How fear can be turned into focus<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;"Ghost" strikes and takedowns<br><i>Mind Fist </i>brilliantly unlocks an ancient skill of true, permanent self-defense--for any aspect of your life! <br><br> For academic study only <br><br><b>Dr. Haha Lung</b> is the author of more than a dozen books on martial arts, including <i>Assassin!, Mind Manipulation, Ninja Shadowhand, Knights of Darkness, Mind Control: The Ancient Art of Psychological Warfare,</i> and <i>The Lost Fighting Arts of Vietnam.</i></p><p><b>Dr. Haha Lung</b> is the author of more than a dozen books on martial arts, including <i>Mind Penetration</i>, <i>Mind</i> <i>Fist</i>, <i>The Nine Halls of Death</i>, <i>Assassin!</i>, <i>Mind</i> <i>Manipulation</i>, <i>Knights</i> <i>of</i> <i>Darkness</i>, <i>Mind Control: The Ancient Art of Psychological Warfare</i>, <i>The Lost Fighting Arts of Vietnam</i>, and with co-author Christopher B.

Along the way they changed the course of the conservative movement and had a significant impact on shaping contemporary political debates from constitutional interpretation, civil rights, to the corruption of government today. Most importantly, these thinkers explain the deep reasons for patriotism&#x2014;why we should love America not just because it is <i>our country</i>, but because it is a free and just country.<br></p><p>Steven F. Hayward is a visiting scholar at the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. He is the author of the two-volume political biography <i>The Age of Reagan: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order, 1964-1980</i>, and <i>The Age of Reagan: The Conservative Counter-Revolution, 1980-1989</i>. He has written for the <i>New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>Weekly Standard, National Review,</i> and numerous other periodicals.&#x201c;Is Walter Berns still alive?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Yes. He&#x2019;s 95 and in poor health, but I think Walter and Harry [age 96] are seeing who can outlive the other as the last act in their long-running feud.&#x201d; <br><br>I offered that whimsical speculation the week after Christmas in 2014 at a meeting at the Claremont Institute. About two weeks later, on Saturday, January 10, the Weekly Standard magazine was the first to publish on its website the sad news that Berns had passed away that morning. Jaffa, also in failing health, had gone to the hospital the day before. He was slipping in and out of consciousness, but intermittently awake enough to make the standard complaints about the usual defects of hospital life. His family and visiting students were guardedly optimistic; he had overcome several acute crises and hospitalizations before. But he took a turn for the worse, and when he passed away a few hours later, the comparison to Thomas Jefferson and John Adams passing on the same day in 1826 became inescapable. <br><br>Jefferson and Adams had been bitter political rivals, culminating in the close and initially inconclusive election of 1800 that could easily have ended in the ruin of the still infant nation. Abraham Lincoln taught, as Jaffa never tired of reminding students, that the election of 1800 was the first to prove that ballots could replace bullets as the means of changing a government. <br><br>Adams and Jefferson reconciled in later years, chiefly because the two giants of the American Founding shared the same basic political philosophy, which slowly dissolved the rancor of personal ambition and party spirit that dominated their poor relations for the better part of a decade. Some of their political and constitutional disputes had deep theoretical roots, turning on subtle shadings of how republican concepts should be understood and practiced. Jefferson had some radical inclinations at times, like that &#x201c;God forbid we should ever be 20 years without such a rebellion&#x201d; musing he once made in a private letter, while Adams was the prototypical cautious conservative. Arguing politely and respectfully over their differences in a long correspondence became one of their favorite pastimes in retirement. <br><br>Jaffa and Berns never contested each other for political office, but their arguments over the course of a decade took on the bitterness and personal invective of partisan strife. &#x201c;In your present state of mind,&#x201d; Jaffa wrote in one public letter to Berns, &#x201c;nothing less than a metaphysical two-by-four across the frontal bone would capture your attention.&#x201d; One of Berns&#x2019;s retorts began: &#x201c;Who will rid us of this pest of a priest?&#x201d; Unlike Jefferson and Adams, they never reconciled their intellectual differences, although the feud gradually burned itself out, and the two old giants did once sit together and talk cordially, if a bit stiffly, over lunch in Washington, a meal carefully brokered by the Claremont Institute around 2005. It wasn&#x2019;t necessary to confiscate the forks and knives. By then Jaffa had turned his attention to new feuds with other targets, and Berns was happy to pass the bull&#x2019;s-eye on his back to Allan Bloom, Robert Bork, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justice Antonin Scalia. <br><br>Epic academic feuds are common, but are often about trivial or obscure matters. It is a mistake to explain the Jaffa-Berns quarrel as an example of the narcissism of small differences, or still less the simple pride or one-upmanship typical of most academic fights that have little consequence in the real world. But the differences between Jaffa and Berns and their allied camps that seem abstract or remote on the surface are connected to a serious question, perhaps the most serious political question of this or any time: What kind of country is America? What is the right or best basis for patriotism? Is democracy capable of being understood and conducted nobly? Above all, can these questions be answered without recourse to pondering deeply the nature and condition of the human soul?</p><h2>Everyone Communicates Few Connect</h2><p>The ability to connect with others is a major determining factor in reaching your full potential.

But when one of Serenity&#39;s crew is taken captive and tortured, the gang must put their enduring differences aside and work together to save one of their own, even if it means losing the cash prize of a lifetime! Joss Whedon returns to the world of his blockbuster film Serenity, reuniting with Brett Matthews and Will Conrad, his collaborators on the bestselling 2005 series Those Left Behind.</p><p><b>Joss Whedon</b> was born in New York City in 1964. He started out as a staff writer for the 1990s sitcom <i>Roseanne</i>&nbsp;and worked on films, including <i>Toy Story</i>. In 1992 he penned the script for a film,&nbsp;<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, and&nbsp;when the TV version starring Sarah Michelle Gellar took off in 1997, Whedon had his big break&#x2014;with its female action heroine, Buffy, became a huge hit. Whedon wrote hundreds of episodes for <i>Buffy</i> and its spin-off <i>Angel</i>, and was nominated for Emmy and Hugo awards for his work. Whedon has come to enjoy a cult following. The author lives in Santa Monica, California.<br><br><b>Patton Oswalt </b>is a comedian, actor, author, and screenwriter. Oswalt is perhaps best known as the voice of Remy the rat in the film,&nbsp;<i>Ratatouille</i>, but he also gained prominence during the '90s as one of the premier West Coast stand-up comedians. Oswalt's albums <i>Feelin' Kinda Patton, Werewolves and Lollipops, </i>and <i>My Weakness Is Strong </i>are staples of the genre. Oswalt has also been featured in <i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>King of Queens</i>,<i> Big Fan</i>,<i> Young Adult</i>, and <i>The Goldbergs.&nbsp;</i><br><br><b>Zack Whedon </b>is a film director and writer for television and comic books. Whedon was educated at Wesleyan University. He began his TV writing career with the HBO show <i>Deadwood</i>&nbsp;and has written and produced a number of other high-profile projects. In the comic book world, Whedon is known for his work on <i>Serenity</i>, <i>The Terminator</i>, and <i>Dr. Horrible. </i>He is the brother of Joss Whedon.<br><br><b>Brett Matthews</b> is a television writer and producer best known for his work on <i>The Vampire Diaries </i>and <i>Supernatural</i>. He also wrote two comic book prequels in the&nbsp;<i>Serenity </i>franchise: <i>Serenity: Those Left Behind</i> and <i>Serenity: Better Days.&nbsp;</i>When Whedon&#x2019;s beloved TV show Firefly was canceled, fans were left with a little spaceship-shaped hole in their hearts. This second entry in the Serenity comic-book series, which essentially presents new episodes in graphic format, should help mollify them. Whedon&#x2019;s sensibility works well here, as primary hero/rogue Mal Reynolds and his crew balance snarky asides and verbal sparring with cloaked sentimentality and plenty of western-styled space-opera action. While most of the in-jokes, character quirks, and background references will only resonate with those already in the know, that is a pretty sizable&#x2014;and hungry&#x2014;population in its own right.

Virginia Woolf<br><br>Virginia Woolf was not the only writer to admire Mansfield's work: Thomas Hardy, D. H.

The stories that pay what Mansfield calls 'a debt of love' to New Zealand are as<br>sharply etched as the European stories, and she recreates her childhood world with mordant insight.

ALA Notable Book. Reprint.</p><p>Funny young adult writers are a rare treasure, and Joan Bauer is one of the funniest. Critics and young readers rejoiced at her three previous novels--<i>Squashed</i>, <i>Thwonk</i>, and <i>Sticks</i>--and with <i>Rules of the Road</i>, she has written a story that is wise and touching as well as comical. Jenna Boller is too tall for a sophomore and she's not much good in school. Her sister Faith got all the looks in the family, but boy, can Jenna sell shoes! She's supremely happy at her after-school job at Gladstone's, where the big white sign over the door says "We're Not Just Selling Shoes, We're Selling Quality." When elderly Mrs. Madeline Gladstone, the crusty president of the company, chooses Jenna as her driver on a business trip to visit other Gladstone's stores, Jenna goes reluctantly--with trepidation at driving the huge Cadillac, and at the prospect of leaving her alcoholic father behind. But on the road, Jenna learns "great road truths" such as "Never eat at a place called Mom's, because it's a safe bet Mom's been dead for years." She also proves to be indispensable (possessing an eagle eye for shoddy quality and sloppy service), and soon learns to admire and love the irascible Mrs. Gladstone as well as her old friend, "World's Best Shoe Salesman" Harry Bender. When Harry dies suddenly, Jenna realizes that she wishes he had been her father. Trouble looms in the form of a company takeover by Mrs. Gladstone's sleazy son, Elden, "Shoe Rodent," but Jenna summons courage from Harry's memory and saves the day for quality shoes. <i>Rules of the Road</i> is a treat that will utterly delight readers. (Age 12 and older) <i>--Patty Campbell</i>Jenna Boller is the best employee at her branch of Gladstone&#39;s Shoes -- she can sell anybody anything. But her family problems are harder to handle, and there are times when Jenna wishes she could just get out of town and take a break. So when Madeline Gladstone, the elderly president of Gladstone Shoe Stores, hires Jenna as her driver for the summer, Jenna leaps at the chance -- right into the driver&#39;s seat. And that begins a cross-country adventure from Chicago to Dallas, where she and Mrs. Gladstone learn a lot about the rules of the road . . . and the rules of life.</p><h2>Death Check - #2 Destroyer</h2><p>The second book in the long running &#34;Destroyer Series&#34; finds our hero, Remo Williams finding his way on his own; trying to stop an evil plan of world domination. The big brains behind the business usually have many pots boiling on their stove, or running their think engines, as the case may be. But when the business motto of the Brewster forum, &#34;Pursuing Research Into Original Thought&#34;, leads them to some eccentric affairs that throw them far enough off track, Remo Williams enlists the help of his Master Chiun to solve a harrowing crime. The Destroyer Series centers around the adventures of Remo Williams. Remo is a Newark, N.J. police officer who gets framed for a drug dealer&#39;s murder.

She has published over a hundred novels, and her work has been optioned and made into films, excerpted in Good Housekeeping, and has been translated into over twenty-five different languages and published all over the world. With over 400 million copies of her books in print worldwide, she is truly a publishing phenomenon.<p>The week a magazine like<i> Celebrity</i> went to bed was utter chaos. Every department head was in a frenzy. Desks were littered, phones were tied up and lunches were skipped. The air was tinged with a sense of panic that built with every hour. Tempers grew short, demands outrageous. In most offices the lights burned late into the night. The rich scent of coffee and the sting of tobacco smoke were never absent. Rolls of antacids were consumed and bottles of eye drops constantly changed hands. After five years on staff, Lee took the monthly panic as a matter of course.</p> <p><i>Celebrity</i> was a slick, respected publication whose sales generated millions of dollars a year. In addition to stories on the rich and famous,it ran articles by eminent psychologists and journalists, interviews with both statesmen and rock stars. Its photography was first&#x2013;class, just as its text was thoroughly researched and concisely written.Some of its detractors might have termed it quality gossip, but the word<i> quality</i> wasn't forgotten.</p> <p>An ad in <i>Celebrity</i> was a sure bet for generating sales and interest and was priced accordingly.<i> Celebrity</i> was, in a tough competitive business, one of the leading monthly publications in the country. Lee Radcliffe wouldn't have settled for less.</p> <p>"How'd the piece on the sculptures turn out?"</p> <p>Lee glanced up at Bryan Mitchell, one of the top photographers on the West Coast. Grateful, she accepted the cup of coffee Bryan passed her. In the past four days, she'd had a total of twenty hours sleep. "Good," she said simply.</p> <p>"I've seen better art scrawled in alleys."</p> <p>Though she privately agreed, Lee only shrugged. "Some people like the clunky and obscure."</p> <p>With a laugh, Bryan shook her head. "When they told me to photograph that red and black tangle of wire to its best advantage, I nearly asked them to shut off the lights."</p> <p>"You made it look almost mystical."</p> <p>"I can make a junkyard look mystical with the right lighting."She shot Lee a grin."The same way you can make it sound fascinating."</p> <p>A smile touched Lee's mouth but her mind was veering off in a dozen other directions. "All in a day's work, right?"</p> <p>"Speaking of which&#x2014;" Bryan rested one slim jean&#x2013;clad hip on Lee's organized desk, drinking her own coffee black. "Still trying to dig something up on Hunter Brown?"</p> <p>A frown drew Lee's elegant brows together. Hunter Brown was becoming her personal quest and almost an obsession. Perhaps because he was so completely inaccessible, she'd become determined to be the first to break through the cloud of mystery. It had taken her nearly five years to earn her title as staff reporter, and she had a reputation for being tenacious, thorough and cool. Lee knew she'd earned those adjectives. Three months of hitting blank walls in researching Hunter Brown didn't deter her. One way or the other, she was going to get the story.</p> <p>"So far I haven't gotten beyond his agent's name and his editor's phone number." There might've been a hint of frustration in her tone, but her expression was determined."I've never known people so closemouthed."</p> <p>"His latest book hit the stands last week." Absently, Bryan picked up the top sheet from one of the tidy piles of papers Lee was systematically dealing with. "Have you read it?"</p> <p>"I picked it up, but I haven't had a chance to start it yet." Bryan tossed back the long honey&#x2013;colored braid that fell over her shoulder. "Don't start it on a dark night." She sipped at her coffee, then gave a laugh. "God, I ended up sleeping with every light in the apartment burning. I don't know how he does it."</p> <p>Lee glanced up again, her eyes calm and confident. "That's one of the things I'm going to find out."</p> <p>Bryan nodded. She'd known Lee for three years, and she didn't doubt Lee would. "Why?" Her frank, almond&#x2013;shaped eyes rested on Lee's. "Because&#x2014;" Lee finished off her coffee and tossed the empty cup into her overflowing wastebasket "&#x2014;no one else has."</p> <p>"The Mount Everest syndrome," Bryan commented, and earned a rare, spontaneous grin.</p> <p>A quick glance would have shown two attractive women in casual conversation in a modern, attractively decorated office. A closer look would have uncovered the contrasts. Bryan, in jeans and a snug T&#x2013;shirt, was completely relaxed. Everything about her was casual and not quite tidy, from her smudged sneakers to the loose braid. Her sharp&#x2013;featured, arresting face was touched only with a hasty dab of mascara. She'd probably meant to add lipstick or blusher and then forgotten.</p> <p>Lee, on the other hand, wore a very elegant ice&#x2013;blue suit, and the nerves that gave her her drive were evident in the hands that were never quite still. Her hair was expertly cut in a short swinging style that took very little care&#x2014;which was every bit as important to her as having it look good. Its shade fell somewhere between copper and gold. Her skin was the delicate, milky white some redheads bless and others curse. Her makeup had been meticulously applied that morning, down to the dusky blue shadow that matched her eyes. She had delicate, elegant features offset by a full and obviously stubborn mouth.</p> <p>The two women had entirely different styles and entirely different tastes but oddly enough, their friendship had begun the moment they'd met. Though Bryan didn't always like Lee's aggressive tactics and Lee didn't always approve of Bryan's laidback approach, their closeness hadn't wavered in three years. "So." Bryan found the candy bar she'd stuck in her jeans pocket and proceeded to unwrap it."What's your master plan?"</p> <p>"To keep digging," Lee returned almost grimly. "I do have a couple of connections at Horizon, his publishing house. Maybe one of them'll come through with something." Without being fully aware of it, she drummed her fingers on the desk. "Damn it, Bryan, he's like the man who wasn't there. I can't even find out what state he lives in."</p> <p>"I'm half inclined to believe some of the rumors," Bryan said thoughtfully. Outside Lee's office someone was having hysterics over the final editing of an article. "I'd say the guy lives in a cave somewhere, full of bats with a couple of stray wolves thrown in.He probably writes the original manuscript in sheep's blood."</p> <p>"And sacrifices virgins every new moon."</p> <p>"I wouldn't be surprised." Bryan swung her feet lazily while she munched on her chocolate bar."I tell you the man's weird."</p> <p>"<i>Silent Scream</i>'s already on the bestseller list."</p> <p>"I didn't say he wasn't brilliant," Bryan countered, "I said he was weird. What kind of a mind does he have?" She shook her head with a half&#x2013;sheepish smile."I can tell you I wished I'd never heard of Hunter Brown last night while I was trying to sleep with my eyes open."</p> <p>"That's just it." Impatient, Lee rose and paced to the tiny window on the east wall. She wasn't looking out; the view of Los Angeles didn't interest her. She just had to move around.</p> <p>"What kind of mind <i>does</i> he have? What kind of life does he live?</p> <p>Is he married? Is he sixty&#x2013;five or twenty&#x2013;five? Why does he write novels about the supernatural?" She turned, her impatience and her annoyance showing beneath the surface of the sophisticated grooming. "Why did you read his book?"</p> <p>"Because it was fascinating," Bryan answered immediately.</p> <p>"Because by the time I was on page 3, I was so into it you couldn't have gotten the book away from me with a crowbar."</p> <p>"And you're an intelligent woman."</p> <p>"Damn right," Bryan agreed and grinned. "So?"</p> <p>"Why do intelligent people buy and read something that's going to terrify them?" Lee demanded. "When you pick up a Hunter Brown, you know what it's going to do to you, yet his books consistently spring to the top of the bestseller list and stay there. Why does an obviously intelligent man write books like that?" She began, in a habit Bryan recognized, to fiddle with whatever was at hand&#x2014;the leaves of a philodendron, the stub of a pencil, the left earring she'd removed during a phone conversation.</p> <p>"Do I hear a hint of disapproval?"</p> <p>"Yeah, maybe." Frowning, Lee looked up again. "The man is probably the best colorist in the country. If he's describing a room in an old house, you can smell the dust. His characterizations are so real you'd swear you'd met the people in his books. And he uses that talent to write about things that go bump in the night. I want to find out why."</p> <p>Bryan crumpled her candy wrapper into a ball. "I know a woman who has one of the sharpest, most analytical minds I've ever come across. She has a talent for digging up obscure facts, some of them impossibly dry, and turning them into intriguing stories. She's ambitious, has a remarkable talent for words, but works on a magazine and lets a half&#x2013;finished novel sit abandoned in a drawer. She's lovely, but she rarely dates for any purpose other than business. And she has a habit of twisting paper clips into ungodly shapes while she's talking."</p> <p>Lee glanced down at the small mangled piece of metal in her hands, then met Bryan's eyes coolly. "Do you know why?"</p> <p>There was a hint of humor in Bryan's eyes, but her tone was serious enough. "I've tried to figure it out for three years, but I can't precisely put my finger on it."</p> <p>With a smile, Lee tossed the bent paper clip into the trash. "But then, you're not a reporter." <br></p> <p>Because she wasn't very good at taking advice, Lee switched on her bedside lamp, stretched out and opened Hunter Brown's latest novel. She would read a chapter or two, she decided, then make it an early night. An early night was an almost sinful luxury after the week she'd put in at <i>Celebrity</i>.</p> <p>Her bedroom was done in creamy ivories and shades of blue from the palest aqua to indigo. She'd indulged herself here, with dozens of plump throw pillows, a huge Turkish rug and a Queen Anne stand that held an urn filled with peacock feathers and eucalyptus. Her latest acquisition, a large ficus tree, sat by the window and thrived.</p> <p>She considered this room the only truly private spot in her life. As a reporter, Lee accepted that she was public property as much as the people she sought out. Privacy wasn't something she could cling to when she constantly dug into other people's lives. But in this little corner of the world, she could relax completely, forget there was work to do, ladders to climb. She could pretend L.A. wasn't bustling outside, as long as she had this oasis of peace. Without it, without the hours she spent sleeping and unwinding there, she knew she'd overload.</p> <p>Knowing herself well, Lee understood that she had a tendency to push too hard, run too fast. In the quiet of her bedroom she could recharge herself each night so that she'd be ready for the race again the following day.</p> <p>Relaxed, she opened Hunter Brown's latest effort.</p> <p>Within a half hour, Lee was disturbed, uncomfortable and completely engrossed. She'd have been angry with the author for drawing her in if she hadn't been so busy turning pages. he'd put an ordinary man in an extraordinary situation and done it with such skill that Lee was already relating to the teacher who'd found himself caught up in a small town with a dark secret.</p> <p>The prose flowed and the dialogue was so natural she could hear the voices. He filled the town with so many recognizable things, she could have sworn she'd been there herself. She knew the story was going to give her more than one bad moment in the dark, but she had to go on. That was the magic of a major storyteller. Cursing him, she read on, so tense that when the phone rang beside her, the book flew out of her hands. Lee swore again, at herself, and lifted the receiver.</p> <p>Her annoyance at being disturbed didn't last. Grabbing a pencil, she began to scrawl on the pad beside the phone. With her tongue caught between her teeth, she set down the pencil and smiled. She owed the contact in New York an enormous favor, but she'd pay off when the time came, as she always did. For now, Lee thought, running her hand over Hunter's book, she had to make arrangements to attend a small writers' conference in Flagstaff, Arizona.</p></p><h2>Leonardo Da Vinci, the Complete Paintings &amp; Drawings</h2><p>The quintessential &#34;Renaissance man,&#34; Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) is still recognized today for his accomplishments in science, architecture, and philosophy, as well as his artistic masterworks. Full-color reproductions and thorough text provide a solid introduction to this master. In the past decade we have seen a whole series of spectacular new discoveries relating to Leonardo da Vinci, discoveries that are starting to change our understanding of his art for good. In the sphere of conservation science, in particular, ever more sophisticated methods of diagnostic scanning-using X-ray and infrared technologies, for example-are yielding impressive results. With the advances in modern imaging techniques, we are today able not only to access details of Leonardo&#39;s paintings that previously lay quite literally hidden from view, but to study them in visual formats that allow us to make sense of what we are seeing. In this beautifully illustrated book, Frank Zollner uncovers the young artist in Florence, da Vinci&#39;s beginnings as a court artist in Milan, the artist and &#34;science,&#34; and his last years. He profiles da Vinci&#39;s drawings and sketches for surviving or documented paintings, his anotomical drawings, his allegories, studies of engineering and military equipment, and his work in proportion and light and shade.</p><p></p><h2>The Compleat Cruiser: The Art, Practice &amp; Enjoyment of Boating</h2><p>The Compleat Cruiser - The Art, Practice and Enjoyment of Boating by L Francis Herreshoff Inspired by Izaak Walton&#39;s The Compleat Angler, this book is accurately subtitled &#34;The Art, Practice and Enjoyment of Boating&#39;. A classic in the field, it is a comprehensive survey of boating that has been and will continue to be a joy to all those who find pleasure and recreation on the water. Starting with a kayak-type canoe, Mr. Herreshoff takes us on family-style cruises in American waters, during which all sorts of boats and boating skills are explained while they are used. He tells about the adventures of the crews of the catboat Piscator, the ketch Viator, and the engineless, whaleboat-style ketch Rozinante. There are anecdotes and examples and a wide variety of boat lore in each chapter. There are adventures, races and coastwise cruises and historical harbors to visit. The author, L.

But then his nine-year-old foster daughter, Mi-ja, is abducted, and her kidnappers demand a ransom Burkowicz doesn&#x2019;t have: a priceless jade skull from the age of Genghis Khan. Sue�o and Bascom&#x2014;more accustomed to chasing felons and black marketeers in the back alleys of Itaewon than ancient treasures&#x2014;go in over their heads as they agree to search for the skull, a journey that will lead them to a crime that threatens the fragile peace between South Korea and the US Army units living on its Korean soil.</p><p>Both <i>Jade Lady Burning</i> and <i>Slicky Boys</i> were praised for their blending of the noir thriller with the police procedural. In Martin Lim�n's third tale of George Sueno and his army CID partner, Ernie Bascom, the two are enmeshed in the dark and light sides of Buddhism as they again exercise their police skills in a thriller's world. When they come to the aid of a Buddhist nun who is being attacked by what appears to be a GI, Ernie finds himself the keeper of "Buddha's money." He'll need the sacred money as he and George pursue the kidknappers of Mi-ja, the adopted daughter of ex-infantry sergeant, Herman the German. What Herman, Ernie, and George soon discover is that Mi-ja is only the grisly negotiating tool of a man who believes himself the reincarnation of an ancient conqueror. This madman is in relentless pursuit of a jade skull supposed to be the key to the future of the Pacific Rim. A trade--the skull for the girl--seems like the easy solution. But Lady Ahn, the proclaimed heir to the Dragon Throne of China, is not about to give it up.<p> While this mosaic of Buddhist cults and supernatural relics sounds like the stuff of a 1940s radio drama, it is grounded and modernized in Martin Lim�n's fascination with his two main characters. In particular, Lim�n holds a powerful magnet to George Sueno's moral compass, and the consistency in George's voice, as twisted as it is, invites the reader into a world that is teeming with desparate "business girls" and wasted souls. Ernie's penchant for violence and dark humor complements George's cynicism. Gradually, one is moved from fascination to repulsion before settling into a steady enjoyment of an exotic mystery. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Praise for Martin Limn's <i>Slicky Boys:</i><p>"These boys are no sweethearts, and their smash-and-burn investigative techniques would get them arrested back home.

A lifelong Republican, Cutler also served three Denocratic presidents. The life of any party, he was a tight-lipped loyalist who worked behind the scenes to get things done. While Cutler's contributions to the public sphere may not have received, until now, the consideration they deserve, the story of his private life has never before been told.<br><br>Cutler struggled throughout his years in the White House to discover and embrace his own sexual identity and orientation, and he was in love with a man half his age, NSC staffer Skip Koons. Cutler poured his emotions into a six-volume diary and dozens of letters that have been hidden from history. Steve Benedict, who was White House security officer, Cutlers' friend and Koons' friend and former lover, preserved Cutler's papers. All three men served Eisenhower at a time when anyone suspected of "sexual perversion", i.e. homosexuality, was banned from federal employment and vulnerable to security sweeps by the FBI.</p><p>Peter Shinkle worked for 19 years as a reporter at various news organizations, including most recently the&nbsp;<i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch</i>. He covered the federal court system, and also wrote investigative stories on subjects ranging from improper disposal of radioactive waste to contamination spread by a lead mining company. Shinkle is the great-nephew of Robert Cutler. It was during a family vacation in 2006 that his mother, Judith Cutler Shinkle, and his aunt told him that their "Uncle Bobby" was gay. That sparked a 12-year endeavor to explore the story of the man who was one of President Eisenhower's closest advisors."A&nbsp;superb and harrowing history of a dual life in a dark era of official oppression...constantly surprising...one of the most rewarding books of popular history I have ever read." <b>&#x2014; Charles Kaiser in <i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>"The never-before-told story of one of the key figures in the Cold War . . .&nbsp;a scintillating tale that shows the personal sacrifices Cutler endured to serve his country, which viewed LGBTQ folks as criminal deviants and a threat to national security." <b>&#x2014; <i>The&nbsp;Advocate</i>, A Best Book of the Year<br><br></b>"A genuinely engrossing read . . .

In this lively account of one season, he introduces us to the tightly knit world of a fire crew, to the complex geography of the North Rim, to the technique and changing philosophy of fire management. Firefighters, the migrant workers of the National Park Service, look askance at its career employees, we're told: Park Naturalists are "fern feelers" and Rangers are simply police officers. Pyne makes trenchant comments about the Park Service and its emphasis on people rather than resource management; as more visitors come into an area, Rangers replace fire crews. A firefighter needs resourcefulness and stamina, writes Pyne, and these qualities are amply represented in his tales of men in the field, forest and on the Rim. The book will appeal to readers who enjoy action; it will also appeal to those interested in the human-wildfire-nature relationship. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Adolf H.

"I wish it could go on forever, Annja, this vacation."<br><br>"But we've only got another four days," she said.<br><br>"Maybe we should leave this bungalow and see a bit of the countryside? We didn't travel halfway around the world to Thailand to spend all our time in bed."<br><br>"Speak for yourself." He chuckled.<br><br>Annja reveled in his voice, throaty and rich with a sensuous Argentine accent. She waited for him to speak again, but when he didn't, she edged away and pressed herself against the glass door. It was cool with the rain that had blotted out the July sun. She followed a rivulet with her finger as it slithered down the pane.<br><br>The patter was gentle, like his breath on her shoulder, and it made the green of the trees beyond their cabin more intense.<br><br>They'd found this resort on the internet, though there were no public internet connections available in the lodge or any of the cabins. Wireless service didn't exist here. Neither were there television sets, nor telephones, save an old rotary one in the office. With that they had both immediately agreed on the place, as they could keep the world at bay for a while.<br><br>Annja had been in South America, filming a segment for <em>Chasing History's Monsters </em>on the fossils of ancient penguinlike creatures that had been discovered in the mountains. She'd met Luartaro Agustin at one of the dig sites there.<br><br>He was charming and smart, and when he'd surprised her by suggesting that they spend some more time together, she'd hesitated only a moment.<br><br>She desperately needed time off&#x2014;from the show, from her life, from everything. So right there in his lavish office, she'd twirled the huge globe that took up most of one corner, closed her eyes and pointed her finger.<br><br>Luartaro had come over to see where her finger had landed. Northern Thailand. She'd surprised him by walking over to his immense oak desk and calling the airline to make a reservation. For two.<br><br>As she watched the rain, she thought that perhaps Luartaro had fallen in love with her, though he wisely hadn't said the words.<br><br>Would those words frighten her away? Did she love him? Not yet. But perhaps...with time... She'd only known him a handful of days before they'd recklessly packed their bags and flown here. She'd learned through difficult circumstances that life was terribly short, and she decided to take a chance on joy for once.<br><br><em>Could </em>she love him? Perhaps if she let herself. The attraction, physical and otherwise, was strong.<br><br>She watched the way the rain distorted his handsome reflection.<br><br>He had a rugged face weathered by long days in the sun, a shock of black hair with the faintest hints of silver at the temples, broad shoulders and considerable muscles from years spent digging at sites throughout the mountains and foothills of South America.<br><br>He had flashing eyes that she could easily lose herself in. <em>Had </em>lost herself in, she corrected herself. He was intelligent&#x2014;in addition to being an archaeologist, he taught at a college during the regular academic year, had written three textbooks and was fluent in half a dozen languages. Though, unfortunately, Thai was not one of them. They had a lot in common.<br><br>Perhaps she was reading too much into his actions. After all, he knew very little about her, which was a plus, as far as she was concerned.<br><br>He didn't know that danger too often surrounded her and that some mystic force seemed to have chosen her to battle evil.<br><br>She hadn't told him that she was an orphan with little sense of a real connection to people. Nor had she told him&#x2014;and never intended to&#x2014;that on a whim she could summon Joan of Arc's sword from some nether-dimension to fight whatever malignant force had crossed her path.<br><br>She had been on a dig in France when she found a piece of the legendary sword. She didn't know how, but in a heartbeat, magically reformed by her touch, it had appeared in her hand, whole and shining, more than five hundred years after its famous wielder had been put to death by fire. Now the sword was poised just beyond this world, waiting for her call. She sometimes thought of it as waiting in a closet in her mind, though <em>armory </em>might be a better term.<br><br>Because of the sword and her risky life, she never allowed herself to become too attached to people. She had Roux and Garin, but they were associated with the sword, Roux claiming they had witnessed Joan's horrific death and had existed in a kind of decadent limbo in the centuries since.<br><br>Luartaro was different. Like so many others, he wasn't a part of that life. Normally, she would have kept her emotions in check. But there was something special about him. She felt things for him that she hadn't intended.<br><br>And what does he think of me? she wondered. Did he consider her merely a television personality with a flair for archaeology? Or was she just another woman who had quickly succumbed to his boyish grin?<br><br>She watched his reflection in the window again. He had moved close enough that he was stroking her hair again, but he, too, was staring out at the rain and the mountains beyond.<br><br>The view was the reason she was paying eight hundred baht a night for their cabin, four times what the average room cost. It was more lavishly furnished than most of the other accommodations at the lodge. It even had its own bath and shower. But best of all, it offered an incredible view of the lush countryside.<br><br>Beyond the sliding glass doors was the path that led to the swimming hole and another that wound its way to the small restaurant that served only native Thai dishes. The rain was slowly turning those paths into mud slicks.<br><br>In the distance, the mountains that ringed the place disappeared into the gloom. "Complicated mountain ranges," one of the locals had called them on the bus ride to the resort. Misty clouds hung halfway down them, and the rain was blurring the rest.<br><br>Mae Hong Son was called the City of Three Mists because no matter the time of year, there were always low-hanging clouds present. "Three" because the mists were different&#x2014;the forest-fire mist of the summer, the rainy mist in the monsoon season and the dewy mist of their mild winter.<br><br>The area had long been considered a "land of exile" because it was largely inaccessible, but tourists had eventually found the place, and buses and rental cars brought them in from larger cities. She and Luartaro had opted for a bus, the seats of which had not been very well padded.<br><br>Mae Hong Son claimed a hot spring, small and large crystal clear streams and a magnificent cape&#x2014;none of which Annja had seen. There was an elaborate Buddhist temple nearby, so the brochures said, and a tribe where the women elongated their necks with a series of rings&#x2014;the Karen of the Pa Dong.<br><br>"I think we should do something touristy," she said, breaking the silence that had settled comfortably between them. "Maybe we could take an elephant ride or do some mountain biking. The pamphlets&#x2014;" she pointed at the nightstand "&#x2014;say they have meditation classes in the mornings, rafting and&#x2014;"<br><br>"If you want to venture outside," Luartaro interrupted, "why don't we visit a spirit cave?"<br><br>A shiver raced down Annja's back, and she bit back a <em>No! </em>before it could escape her lips.<br><br>She couldn't explain what brought on the touch of dread, not to herself and not to Luartaro. She could just claim that exploring a cave was too close to her real life as an archaeologist. That wasn't too far from the truth. She hadn't planned to let real life interfere with this long-overdue vacation.<br><br>She shook her head and turned away from the window. He wrapped his arms around her and held her close; he couldn't see the sour, conflicted expression on her face.<br><br>"I saw a flyer about it in the lobby&#x2014;a spirit cave," Luartaro continued. "And I remember it was also mentioned on the internet when we found this place. Ancient coffins carved from trees, burial grounds inside the mountains. There's such a cave less than a day's hike from here, and a guide takes you out in the morning. This area is known for its spectacular limestone caverns. There are hundreds of caves in the mountain ranges. It would be a shame not to visit at least one while we're so close...especially since you want to venture outside."<br><br>She could tell by his voice that the prospect enticed him.<br><br>"All right," she said after a moment. "A spirit cave. First thing tomorrow morning." Another shiver coursed through her.<br><br>"Wonderful! And we'll manage to make time for an elephant ride or some rafting before we leave," he added. "And maybe see the long-necked women and that big Buddhist temple. But for the moment, since it's raining." He drew her toward the bed.<br><br>At first glance, Annja couldn't tell whether the guide was thirty or fifty. His eyes were bright, hinting at youth, but his skin was tanned and leathery from the sun, the wrinkles deep especially at the edges of his eyes. Careworn, she judged his face. His black hair was thin and short, slick with either sweat or oil, and his shoulders hunched slightly.<br><br>He smiled broadly and nodded to their little group. "Zakkarat," he said, holding his index finger to his chest.<br><br>He wore khaki pants, frayed and stained green and brown at the ankles as if he'd never bothered to hem them, instead letting the ground and his heels wear the fabric down to a more suitable length. He had a faded polo shirt with an illustration of a gibbon on it, and over that an unbuttoned short-sleeved shirt that was a riot of color&#x2014;red, blue, green, with birds and flowers. He also wore a cord around his neck with a whistle dangling from it and old black-and-white tennis shoes.<br><br>"Zakkarat," he repeated. "Zakkarat Tak-sin. Your guide to Tham Lod Cave."<br><br>Luartaro reached for Annja's hand and swung it as if he was a child. He was smiling, too, obviously happy to be off to the spirit cave, as the pamphlet called it. His skin felt warm against hers, and she intertwined her fingers with his and reveled in his boyish attitude.<br><br>With them were two other couples, one in their twenties&#x2014;on an ecohoneymoon, they'd proudly announced. The other was a middle-aged Australian pair who were on their third trip to Thailand.<br><br>"Comfortable shoes, all?" Zakkarat looked at everyone's feet.<br><br>"Comfortable shoes, yes," Luartaro replied. The others nodded in agreement.<br><br>"Five, six miles to the cave," Zakkarat said. "Two hundred baht now, more later for extras. Not much more. This is one of the cheapest trips for tourists."<br><br>Luartaro was quick to pay the guide, whispering to Annja that the pamphlet said there would be a charge to enter the cave and for the raft.<br><br>After passing out small water bottles, Zakkarat led the way. He had a quick gait and was nimble, ducking under branches and stepping over ruts, and Annja put him closer to thirty for it. He chattered as he went, pointing first to the tops of the mountains and mentioning the mist. They were unlike other mountains she'd traipsed through, certainly unlike the familiar Rockies and the mountains she and Luartaro had combed through for the ancient penguin remains. These peaks had been weathered away into twisted shapes and odd-looking knobs largely covered by jungle. They were beautiful and ghostlike in the mist.<br><br>She regretted not bringing her camera. Luartaro wasn't taking as many pictures as she would have, or from what she deemed the proper angles. The path Zakkarat took was wide and flat from the traffic of countless tourists. To the sides stretched swaths of dark green moss, still shiny from yesterday's rain.<br><br>Though practically everything was green, there were remarkable variations, Annja noted. Some of the leaves were so pale they appeared bleached bone-white by the sun. Others were a deep green that looked like velvet. Shadows were thick near the ground where the large leaves reminded her of umbrellas. If there were patterns to the colors and light, she couldn't discern them&#x2014; everything was a swirl.<br><br>Had someone taken a picture of the scenery and turned it into a jigsaw puzzle, it would be one of the most difficult ever to assemble, she thought.<br><br>Annja listened intently to hundreds of tiny frogs that chirped like baby birds. After a mile, she spotted a fence far to her left, and a tilled field beyond. On the opposite side the ground rose at a steep angle, and she wondered if there were caves beneath.<br><br>A bit farther along, the Australian man drained his water bottle and looked at his watch. "My feet are hurtin', Jennie," he said. His wife smiled sympathetically and pointed to a thin river that meandered out of the fields to their left. It widened as they kept walking, eventually paralleling the path, which had started to narrow.<br><br>"More than two hundred caves in Pan Mapha in Mae Hong Son alone," Zakkarat announced.<br><br></p><h2>Fall of Eagles</h2><p>Based on a thirteen-part television series, records the events and movements contributing to the decline and fall of the Romanov, Hapsburg, and Hohenzollern dynasties from 1848 to 1918</p><p></p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Triangle (A Brit in the FBI Novel)</h2><p>Recently appointed Covert Eyes team heads Nicholas Drummond and Michaela Caine tackle a dangerous first case when an artifact is stolen from Istanbul and they receive a warning that a series of fatal Gobi sandstorms are actually manmade phenomena.

Coulter lives in Marin County, California.The Devil&#x2019;s Triangle CHAPTER ONE<p></p> <br>Venice, Italy<br> <br>Mid-June<br> <br>One Week Ago<br> <br>Kitsune stood on the Rialto Bridge and watched the sun flash against the waves of the lagoon. She enjoyed the early mornings in Venice, before the summer crowds flooded into the city. She watched pigeons peck the ground for yesterday&#x2019;s crumbs, watched a row of tethered gondolas bob in the heavy sea swell. There would be a storm soon&#x2014;she tasted it in the air. She looked at her watch. It was time to go. Her client had instructed her to take a water taxi to the San Zaccaria dock, then walk to the house.<br> <br>She should have been on her way before now, but she&#x2019;d waited there on the bridge to see who was following her. Even though she hadn&#x2019;t seen anyone yet, she&#x2019;d felt eyes on her, felt them since her plane had landed an hour earlier. At the airport&#x2019;s dock she&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of one of them: a man&#x2014;dark sunglasses, a slouchy work jacket. There were probably others, but where were they? She hated being in the open like this&#x2014;a target&#x2014;and the large tube in her hand a target as well. She still didn&#x2019;t see anyone.<br> <br>She bent down to adjust the strap of her sandal. From the corner of her eye she saw him. She was sure it was the same man she&#x2019;d seen at the Marco Polo airport, still wearing sunglasses and a jacket. He wasn&#x2019;t very good at his job, since she&#x2019;d spotted him, standing in the alley to the left of the Hotel Danieli, chewing on a toothpick like he didn&#x2019;t have a care in the world. But where were the others? She knew she hadn&#x2019;t been followed to Venice, she was sure of that, so why now? For some reason, her client didn&#x2019;t trust her. She felt a lick of anger. It was an insult to her reputation. Or perhaps someone knew what was inside the large tube and wanted it?<br> <br>Ah, there he was, the second man, hovering near the dock, a cap pulled low on his head, wearing wrinkled jeans and scuffed boots. Both men were in their thirties, muscled, garbed in everyday working clothes. Thugs. One was tall, the other short. Mutt and Jeff. She saw no one else. Only two of them? Another insult. She took note of the small sign above Mr. Short&#x2019;s head&#x2014;Calle de la Rasse.<br> <br>Kitsune had learned the complicated layout of the Venetian streets, an integral part of her preparation, since she could run much faster than she could swim.<br> <br>She checked the men out again. Both cocky, sure of themselves, but she could take them. Easily.<br> <br>Not yet, though. The time wasn&#x2019;t right.<br> <br>Their presence bothered her. Why the sudden distrust from her client? Her reputation was built on absolute discretion, always delivering what was commissioned and never asking questions. She had no false modesty. She could steal anything, anywhere&#x2014;even the Koh-i-Noor diamond, that magnificent bloody stone that had nearly gotten her killed. A pity she&#x2019;d had to give it up.<br> <br>This client was paying her a small fortune, and half of it, five million euros, was already deposited in four different accounts in four different banks, as was her custom. She would receive the other five million upon delivery. All of it was straightforward, so why the two thugs following her?<br> <br>Kitsune had been a thief for too long to ignore the prickle of unease that went down her neck. The tube was heavy, and she hugged it closer.<br> <br>The breeze picked up between the Venetian buildings, blowing gently down the narrow canal. She continued forward, over the small bridge, up the walkway, past the arriving gondoliers, who watched her and wondered. Grant told her she moved differently, with singular grace and arrogance, and she looked like what she was&#x2014;strong and dangerous&#x2014;and then he&#x2019;d held her close, stroked her long hair, and whispered against her temple that only the very stupid, or the very desperate, would mess with her. She felt a warm punch to her heart thinking of her husband of ten months, how the green of his eyes turned nearly black when he was kissing her. Soon, she would be with him again. She would give the prize to the client, and be gone.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d fulfilled the first part of the job three days earlier, when she&#x2019;d pulled off one of the most fun heists of her career. She&#x2019;d dyed her hair the deepest black, worn brown contacts, and used a semipermanent stain to make her skin appear two shades deeper, a process she didn&#x2019;t relish, but it helped her blend in beautifully with the population of Istanbul. With her forged credentials, which included a signature from Turkish military leader Hulusi Akar, the palace authorities had followed orders and assigned her to work security at the Topkapi Palace. It had taken her more than three months to work her way out of the harem complex and into special security in the Holy Relics exhibit, where Moses&#x2019;s staff was displayed.<br> <br>Her arms had gotten tired carrying the H&amp;K MP5 machine gun all day. Even with the strap around her neck and shoulder, the carbine got heavy, and being on alert for twelve hours at a time was exhausting. Despite the heat and grit and the hordes of tourists trooping in and out of the treasure-filled rooms in the palace, her assigned areas gave her a lovely view of the Bosphorus. The sun shined on the water, sprinkling diamonds, the sea breezes cooled her, and the tourists gathered nearby to take photos. She was careful, very careful, never to get in the shots. It wouldn&#x2019;t do to have someone post a photo of her on Facebook accidentally, have some government drone monitoring the Internet run the photos through facial recognition, and blow her cover.<br> <br>She wondered again: did her unknown client really believe that what she carried in her hands was the very embodiment of power? That what she carried wasn&#x2019;t simply an ancient knob of wood but the actual staff of Moses? Or, as some called it, Aaron&#x2019;s rod? No matter what it was called, this staff was one of the most sought-after and priceless artifacts in the world, and she&#x2019;d managed to break into the Holy Relics exhibit after hours and take the staff out of its lighted case after cutting the wires to the security alarm, and disappeared. And that brought a smile of satisfaction.<br> <br>No more inky-black hair, no more dark brown eyes, the stain washed away. She was back to her blue eyes, her white skin, and her own dark hair.<br> <br>Yes, it had been a clean, perfectly executed job. One of her best, and she, the Fox, had a string of risky, daring jobs behind her.<br> <br>The international news channels were still leading with the theft. No way was she going to take a chance of being caught in the crosshairs. She&#x2019;d make the delivery, get her other five million, go home to Capri, and talk Grant into visiting Australia or America, anywhere away from Europe. He was due for a vacation, having spent the last three months in Afghanistan guarding a high-ranking British officer.<br> <br>The house she was going to was only a drop site. She&#x2019;d used this protocol many times&#x2014;empty house, the owners probably on vacation. Clients rarely wanted the Fox to know where they lived. She wondered who would be there to receive the stolen staff.<br> <br>A winding alleyway took her deeper into the neighborhoods, along the canals. And there it was, a simple, classic Venetian home&#x2014;red brick, the second and third floors balconied, set between a narrow street and a small canal.<br> <br>She went up the steps, knocked on the dark green door. Waited a moment before the thick, old wood swung open. An older man in a dark suit and silver tie told her to come in.<br> <br>Inside, all was silent. She followed him through a small courtyard, a marble fountain at its center. He showed her into a parlor, to the right of the fountain. The door closed behind her.<br> <br>The room was empty, the silence heavy. She heard voices, a man and a woman, somewhere nearby&#x2014;above her, probably&#x2014;speaking rapid Italian. The clients? Although she understood exactly what they were saying, it still made no sense to her.<br> <br>The woman said clearly, excitement in her voice, &#x201c;I wish I could see it, the Gobi sands&#x2014;a tsunami sweeping over Beijing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We will see it on video,&#x201d; came a man&#x2019;s matter-of-fact voice. &#x201c;All the sand, do you think? Could Grandfather be that good?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know he is. And we will see the aftermath for ourselves. We will leave in three days, after things have calmed down.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man said, marveling, &#x201c;Can you imagine, we are the ones to drain the Gobi?&#x201d;<br> <br>Kitsune stood silently, listening. She shook her head. Drain the Gobi Desert dry? All that sand covering Beijing? By their grandfather? What she&#x2019;d heard, it was nuts, made no sense. An image of Moses raising his staff, parting the Red Sea so the Israelites could escape the Egyptian army flashed through her mind. It was a famous image, given all the paintings and movies, and there were many who believed that was exactly what happened. But not her.<br> <br>Kitsune held by her side a gnarly old piece of wood the Turks had stolen when they&#x2019;d plundered Egypt in 1517, audacious enough or credulous enough to proclaim it to be Moses&#x2019;s staff. She didn&#x2019;t care if it was real or not, it didn&#x2019;t matter. Ten million euros would keep her in bikinis for a long time. She pictured Moses again, only this time she saw him waving his staff to send the sands flying out of the Gobi Desert. Such a strange image.<br> <br>The voices faded away.<br> <br>Moments later, the door to the parlor opened and a man came in. He was short, with dark hair and flat black eyes. This one, in spite of his well-cut dark suit, his perfectly polished boots, couldn&#x2019;t be the client. He looked coarse, crude, a lieutenant playing dress-up. Another thug, only this one with a bit of power, probably running the other who&#x2019;d followed her. So the man and woman she&#x2019;d heard talking wanted him to handle the transaction, then bring them the staff. Fine by her. All she wanted was her money.<br> <br>He crossed the room to the small desk, picked up a silver lighter, and touched it to the end of a cigarette. He blew out a stream of gray smoke and said, in passable English, &#x201c;I am Antonio Pazzi, and you are the Fox. You have the package?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Kitsune set the tube on the desk and stepped back. Pazzi pulled a stiletto from his coat pocket, slit open the top of the cylinder, and upended it. The well-wrapped staff slid out into his waiting hand. He reverently laid it atop the desk and peeled off the packing. He looked at the staff, motionless, staring, but not touching it. Finally, he looked up at her, smiled widely, showing yellow tobacco-stained teeth. &#x201c;I did not believe you would be able to steal this precious rod from the Topkapi. Your reputation is deserved. My masters will be pleased.&#x201d;<br> <br>She saw him press a small button on the desk, and in the next instant she heard a door close, a boat&#x2019;s engine fire to life. So he&#x2019;d signaled the client that she&#x2019;d brought the staff? And they&#x2019;d left. Pazzi handed her a long white envelope. &#x201c;Five million euros. You will leave now.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if she wanted to stay, maybe have a drink with this oily cretin with his yellow teeth. She wanted to open the envelope, but he kept smiling, herding her toward the door, and she felt that familiar shiver down her neck and went on red alert, her body flexed and ready to spring. Were the two men outside the door, waiting for her? Pazzi gave her a small salute, and at the last moment, he slipped past her and slammed the door behind him. She heard the key turn in the lock. In the next moment, another door opened, this time behind her. Mutt and Jeff stepped through, and both held guns in their hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a lovely surprise,&#x201d; she said in Italian, and, quick as a cobra, she dove at Mutt&#x2019;s feet. He had been expecting her to run, and he hesitated a moment. She rolled into him and knocked him backward, his arms flailing for purchase, and he fell against a chair. She popped back to her feet&#x2014;Mutt on her left, struggling to get back up, and Jeff on her right, his Beretta aimed at her chest.<br> <br>Kitsune fell to her knees, whipped out her two Walther PPKs cross-armed, and pulled the triggers almost before she&#x2019;d squared the sights. Jeff fired at the same time. If she&#x2019;d stayed standing, she&#x2019;d be dead. Now he was the one who was dead, sprawled on his back on the floor, blood blooming from his chest. She&#x2019;d missed Mutt, but his gun had clattered to the floor and slid under a red velvet sofa. He sprang to his feet and came at her, fast and hard, fists up and flying, trying to knock the gun away and kill her with his bare hands. He was fast, she&#x2019;d give him that, but she was faster. A heartbeat later he was on the floor with a hole in his forehead.<br> <br>Kitsune had never used guns, but in the past few months, Grant had trained her in them, and trained her well. And when he was satisfied, he&#x2019;d given her the two Walthers. Almost as if Grant had known she would need them. She sent him a silent thank-you as she pointed the gun in her right hand over her shoulder, toward the locked door, just in case, and walked to the opposite side of the room. She listened but didn&#x2019;t hear anything. The house had gone silent. Too silent. As if someone was listening. She had to get out of there, now.<br> <br>She heard voices shouting. She yanked open the door and ran down a long hallway ending in a staircase. The house itself was narrow and old, the walls cool gray stone. She had no choice but to run up the stairs.<br> <br>She heard feet pounding after her, shouts growing closer. Kitsune burst through onto a rooftop terrace. Up this high, she saw that terraces littered the rooftops, and the Venetian houses were crammed cheek by jowl, separated by the small canals that crisscrossed Venice.<br> <br>She didn&#x2019;t look down at the murky canal below, paid no attention to the shouts from the staircase, as men ran up to the terrace. She leaped across to the neighboring terrace. She felt a bullet whiz by her ear, and she dropped and rolled, was on her feet in a second, running to the next terrace. She heard the man leap after her, moving fast, gaining on her. She raced to the end of the rooftop and leaped again, barely missed a window box overflowing with pink and red geraniums, and skidded along the pebbled roof.<br> <br>He followed her, shouting, shooting. People screamed through open windows, gondoliers looked at the sight and shouted, tourists stared up in awe as light-footed Kitsune soared over them like a bird in flight. Laundry lines tumbled into the water below. She was careful to avoid the electric lines; she&#x2019;d be dead and gone before she hit the water if she grabbed one of those by accident.<br> <br>She looked back, saw that it was Pazzi chasing her. She hadn&#x2019;t expected him to be so fast, but he was reaching his limits, and dropping back. With a yell of frustration, he took another shot. The bullet skimmed her arm, cutting the fabric of her shirt, stinging like mad. Blood began running down, turning her hand red. Not good.<br> <br>She made a last desperate leap, grabbed a laundry line, swung down and smashed against the wall of a redbrick house, knocking the air out of her lungs, and dropped, hard, onto the deck of a water taxi.<br> <br>The captain, gap-mouthed, stumbled back, and she pushed him overboard, roared the engine to life and took off. She heard shouts, curses behind her, but didn&#x2019;t look back. She pressed her right hand against the wound in her upper arm.<br> <br>The boat shot out by the San Zaccaria vaporetto station. She was free now, in the lagoon, and she gunned it.<br> <br>She was breathing hard, and bleeding, but for the moment, she was upright and safe, cool water splashing her, the wind tearing through her hair. She heard sirens. The police would be after her any minute now. She had to ditch the boat. It was a thirty-minute run to the airport, but that would be suicide; she co...</p><h2>The 3 Colors of Ministry : A Trinitarian Approach to Identifying and Developing Your Spiritual Gifts</h2><p>Would you like to use your spiritual gifts to their full potential?

The first has three images: school, path, home. The next builds upon the first, giving us: school, street, path, forest, home. The next five sequences take up this story, but with new words and images that nearly double the previous sequence. Here a child encounters the world as he returns home from school, and we see his small world become enormous. This story is as old as the world.

The town is turned (literally) upside down as a witch casts cruel spells, bandits kidnap a queen, demons dance in the night, and a stranger embarks on a perilously heroic quest.

This volume combines both skills as it is a collection of his homilies on his favorite saints, men and women of history who were "inflamed with the love of Christ." In his always descriptive, profound and witty style, Knox shows how these heroes of history struggled with many of the same spiritual battles that modern believers encounter daily, and overcame them with faith, courage, character and virtue. These are the shining witnesses of the truth and charity we all seek to grasp and emulate. <p>In his vivid style, Ronald Knox tells the stories of a variety of these Christian stalwarts including St. Cecilia, St. George, St. Dominic, St. Albert the Great, St. Thomas More, St. Ignatius of Loyola, St. Philip Neri, St. Anselm, St. Joan of Arc, and many more.</p></p><p></p><h2>Weight: The Myth of Atlas and Heracles (The Myths)</h2><p>&#x201c;When I was asked to choose a myth to write about, I realized I had chosen already. The story of Atlas holding up the world was in my mind before the telephone call had ended. If the call had not come, perhaps I would never have written the story, but when the call did come, that story was waiting to be written. Rewritten. The recurring language motif of <i>Weight</i> is &#x2018;I want to tell the story again.&#x2019; My work is full of cover versions. I like to take stories we think we know and record them differently. In the retelling comes a new emphasis or bias, and the new arrangement of the key elements demands that fresh material be injected into the existing text. <i>Weight</i> moves far away from the simple story of Atlas&#x2019;s punishment and his temporary relief when Heracles takes the world off his shoulders. I wanted to explore loneliness, isolation, responsibility, burden, and freedom, too, because my version has a very particular end not found elsewhere.&#x201d; -- from Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s Foreword to <i>Weight</i></p><p>Jeanette Winterson&#x2019;s first novel, Oranges Are Not The Only Fruit, won the Whitbread Prize for Best Novel.

You could have thrown the universe at me and I would have caught it in one hand. There was no universe. It was easy to bear.<br><br>This happy nothing ended fifteen aeons ago. It was a strange time, and what I know is told to me in radioactive whispers; that&#x2019;s all there is left of one great shout into the silence.<br><br>What is it that you contain? The dead. Time. Light patterns of millennia opening in your gut. Every minute, in each of you, a few million potassium atoms succumb to radioactive decay. The energy that powers these tiny atomic events has been locked inside potassium atoms ever since a star-sized bomb exploded nothing into being. Potassium, like uranium and radium, is a long-lived radioactive nuclear waste of the supernova bang that accounts for you.<br><br>Your first parent was a star.<br><br>It was hot as hell in those days. It was Hell, if hell is where the life we love cannot exist. Those ceaseless burning fires and volcanic torments are lodged in us as ultimate fear. The hells we invent are the hells we have known. Hell is; was not, is not, cannot. Science calls it the world before life began &#x2014; the Hadean period. But life had begun, because life is more than the ability to reproduce. In the molten lava spills and cratered rocks, life longed for life. <i>The proto, the almost, the maybe</i>. Not Venus. Not Mars. Earth.<br><br>Planet Earth, that wanted life so badly, she got it.<br><br>Moving forward a few billion years, there was a miracle. At least that&#x2019;s what I call the unexpected fact that changes the story. Earth had bacterial life, but no oxygen, and oxygen was a deadly poison. Then, in a quiet revolution as explosive in its own way as a star, a new kind of bacteria, cyanobacteria started to photosynthesise &#x2014; and a bi-product of photosynthesis is oxygen. Planet earth had a new atmosphere. The rest is history.<br><br>Well not quite. I could list for you the wild optimism of the Cambrian era, pushing up mountains like grass grows daisies, or the Silurian dream-days of starfish and gastropods. About 400 million years ago, shaking salt water from their fins and scales, the first land animals climbed out of the warm lagoons of the vast coral reefs. The Triassic and Jurassic periods belong to the dinosaurs, efficient murder weapons, common as nightmares. Then three or four million years ago &#x2014; chancy and brand new &#x2014; what&#x2019;s this come here &#x2014; a mammoth and something like a man?<br>* * *<br>The earth was amazed. Earth was always strange and new to herself. She never anticipated what she would do next. She never guessed the coming wonder. She loved the risk, the randomness, the lottery probability of a winner. We forget, but she never did, that what we take for granted is the success story. The failures have disappeared. This planet that seems so obvious and inevitable is the jackpot. Earth is the blue ball with the winning number on it.<br><br>Make a list. Look around you. <i>Rock, sand, soil, fruit trees, roses, spiders, snails, frogs, fish, cattle, horses, rainfall, sunshine, you and me</i>. This is the grand experiment called life. What could be more unexpected?<br><br>All the stories are here, silt-packed and fossil-stored. The book of the world opens anywhere, chronology is one method only and not the best. Clocks are not time. Even radioactive rock-clocks, even gut-spun DNA, can only tell time like a story.<br><br>When the universe exploded like a bomb, it started ticking like a bomb too. We know our sun will die, in another hundred million years or so, then the lights will go out and there will be no light to read by any more.<br><br>&#x2018;Tell me the time&#x2019; you say. And what you really say is &#x2018;Tell me a story.&#x2019;<br><br>Here&#x2019;s one I haven&#x2019;t been able to put down.<br><br>Weight of the World<br>My father was Poseidon. My mother was the Earth.<br>My father loved the strong outlines of my mother&#x2019;s body. He loved her demarcations and her boundaries. He knew where he stood with her. She was solid, certain, shaped and material.<br><br>My mother loved my father because he recognised no boundaries. His ambitions were tidal. He swept, he sank, he flooded, he re-formed. Poseidon was a deluge of a man. Power flowed off him. He was deep, sometimes calm, but never still.<br><br>My mother and father teemed with life. They were life. Creation depended on them and had done so before there was air or fire. They sustained so much. They were so much. To each other they were irresistible.<br><br>Both were volatile. My father obviously so, my mother more alarmingly. She was serene as a rock but volcano&#x2019;d with anger. She was quiet as a desert but tectonically challenged. When my mother threw a plate across the room, the whole world felt the crash. My father could be whipped into a storm in moments. My mother grumbled and growled and shook for days or weeks or months until her rage fissured and crumpled entire cities or forced human kind into lava-like submission.<br><br><i>Humankind</i> . . . They never could see it coming. Look at Pompeii. There they are in the bathouses, sitting in their chairs, wearing skeletal looks of charred surprise.<br><br>When my father wooed my mother she lapped it up. He was playful, he was warm, he waited for her in the bright blue shallows and came a little closer, then drew back, and his pull was to leave a little gift on her shore; a piece of coral, mother of pearl, a shell as spiralled as a dream.<br><br>Sometimes he was a long way out and she missed him and the beached fishes gasped for breath. Then he was all over her again, and they were mermaids together, because there was always something feminine about my father, for all his power. Earth and water are the same kind, just as fire and air are their opposites.<br><br>She loved him because he showed her to herself. He was her moving mirror. He took her round the world, the world that she was, and held it up for her to see, her beauty of forests and cliffs and coastlines and wild places. To him she was both paradise and fear and he loved both. Together they went where no human had ever been. Places only they could go, places only they could be. Wherever he went, she was there; a gentle restraint, a serious reminder; <i>the earth and the waters that covered the earth</i>. He knew though, that while he could not cover the whole of her, she underpinned the whole of him. For all his strength, she was strong.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><h2>The New Nikon Compendium: Cameras, Lenses &amp; Accessories Since 1917 (Lark Photography Book)</h2><p>Presenting the thoroughly revised, fully illustrated edition of <i>The Nikon Compendium</i>, updated by the technical editor of Nikon Owner magazine to include all the new Nikon cameras, lenses, and accessories.

Responding to the invitation of Mr. Micah Eaker. Theo gave the butler his card, stripping off his dripping mackintosh, glancing resentfully around the interior of 372 Fifth Avenue, New York City, to which the note waiting at his hotel that afternoon had invited him. </p><p> Theo Hubbard was no larger than a boy. But he'd never let his size confine the scope of his dreams. At twenty-six he'd already earned the confidence of the engineer in chief of the Navy. At the moment he was in civilian clothes, a rumpled brown suit of only modest quality. His lips were firm, his blue eyes determined, his small chin smooth-shaven. For once his hands were free of coal dust and machine grease, though not, he suspected, for long considering what his orders laid out to accomplish over the next ninety days. </p><p> -- You are expected. If you will follow me, sir. </p><p> The room into which he was shown from the chill of an October afternoon had been decorated by someone of taste. Lavender moir� draperies puddled to a figured carpet. Gold-on-cream wallpaper glowed beneath glass torchieres. A black leather settee stood between the front windows, and a huge fireplace mirror reflected prints of the Hudson Valley. A fire crackled on the grate, its reddish heart well nourished, he saw, by a good draft. By the finest Pennsylvania anthracite too, by the smell. Three men in black broadcloth stood around it, holding segars. </p><p> -- Mister Theodorus Hubbard, the butler announced. The paneled door closed softly. </p><p> -- Mister Hubbard. I am Micah Eaker. Thank you for responding to my note. </p><p> A rubicund old gentleman with white chin-tuft. His grip was dry, glance sharp. -- I had not expected so young a man. </p><p> -- The Navy considers me old enough for my responsibilities, sir. </p><p> -- I am sure you will prove up to the mark. My own boy is in the naval service too; in North Carolina, I believe. Though we do not correspond just now. </p><p> -- I have met an Eaker. </p><p> -- We must compare notes. But now let me introduce you to two very good friends of mine. Mister G. L. Barnes, in the employ of Mister Griswold, of Albany. And this is Mister Cornelius Bushnell. Gentlemen, may I present Theodorus Hubbard. Engineer Hubbard has been noticed in the papers both at Fort Sumter and at Gosport, and more recently in the battle at Hatteras. </p><p> Theo shook hands, his natural bumptiousness daunted. Barnes was unknown to him, but John A. Griswold was a major industrialist and very well connected politically -- specifically with the former governor of New York and current secretary of state, William Seward. And Cornelius Scranton Bushnell was probably the most influential man in Connecticut . . . grocery magnate, railroad tycoon, industrialist. They looked down at him as Eaker suggested he help himself to a segar, that whiskey was on the side table, that they all might be more comfortable seated. </p><p> -- Well, sir. It seems appropriate to congratulate you, Bushnell began. Tall and self-assured, with upper lip shaven and a dark beard brushing his stock. -- I am given to understand the chief engineer has put you in charge of our ironclad project. The counterbalance to that great Southern bug-bear, the <i>Merrimack</i>. </p><p> -- Thank you, sir, but it may prove no bug-bear. And I believe Captain Ericsson would claim the distinction of being in charge. </p><p> They chuckled. -- I'm sure he would, but as the Navy's representative you will be responsible for a good deal of the construction. As such, we thought our views might be helpful. </p><p> -- I should be very glad to hear them. </p><p> Old Eaker said, -- Before we begin, boys, you might like to know Hubbard here is from Gideon Welles's hometown. </p><p> -- From Hartford, eh? Do you know the secretary, Mr. Hubbard? </p><p> -- I have had the pleasure of corresponding with him. </p><p> Theo didn't add that it had been in the form of a letter to the then editor of the <i>Hartford Times</i>. From his first startle he was beginning to feel more comfortable. This was the sort of personal examination wealthy, powerful men liked to have with underlings. Which was fine with him. </p><p> One day he intended to be one of them. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Theodorus Coggswell Hubbard had been born on a farm in Weatogue. At twelve he'd walked to Hartford and signed on as a machinery oiler at the Hanbury cotton mill. Hard work, respectful address, and natural ability made him assistant foreman at fifteen, foreman at sixteen, and journeyman machinist and head of loom maintenance at seventeen. On his eighteenth birthday he applied to the best school he could afford, living on his savings as he completed his education. </p><p> When he graduated, the largest toolmaker in town hired him as a master machinist. When the company failed in '55, a notice in the <i>Courant</i> of a board to hire steam engineers in government service caught his eye. </p><p> He'd taken the next morning's train to Washington, changing at New Haven, New York, and Philadelphia, sitting up all night on a hard bench seat. The questions were practical ones, easily answered by anyone who'd run a stationary engine. He was assigned as third assistant engineer in the old paddle wheeler <i>Susquehanna</i>. He went from there to first assistant in <i>Mississippi</i> after her return from shelling the Chinese at Pei Ho, then to <i>Owanee</i> as first engineer. He'd been about to resign and seek a position in engine design when the war had come. </p><p> Clever men with vision, such as Drake and Morse and Rockefeller, were changing the face of the country. America would bring the world wheels of steel and wings of bronze, nerved by electricity and powered by steam. Men like Cyrus McCormick, Eli Whitney, and Joseph Henry were famous and rich. Theo Hubbard wanted these things with the desperation of a man born poor and nearing thirty. </p><p> He had one more reason for bidding farewell to the ocean waves. There were no applicants for the position at present, but he had no doubt of his eligibility for marriage should a suitable candidate appear. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> Barnes said vigorously, -- A fine figure of a man, Welles. Sees to the heart of a matter. </p><p> When the others murmured agreement, Bushnell took up the thread. -- When I presented Captain Ericsson's proposal, he saw at once how revolutionary it was. My own plan looked unimaginative beside it. But we have ironmaking capacity for both and for many more. </p><p> -- Quite so, said Barnes. Then, to Theo, -- Now you, sir, are a prot�g�, one might say, of Mister Isherwood. Not so? </p><p> -- I work for the chief engineer. </p><p> -- Who has great confidence in you. You're a loyal employee. </p><p> -- My previous masters have thought so. </p><p> -- And your opinion of him? </p><p> Theo hesitated, searching the hard faces. Poker would be a child's game to these shrewd financiers, lobbyists, political fixers. -- We worked together, trying to save <i>Merrimack</i> in Norfolk. His "Experiments in Steam Engineering" is a masterpiece. I'm proud to follow where he leads. </p><p> -- Well said. </p><p> -- Quite so. </p><p> Eaker patted his shoulder. -- Well, sir, you leave no doubt where you stand. Let us inquire further. You have seen considerable service afloat. What is your opinion of Captain Ericsson's design? Not so much as to its buildability but as to its . . . seaworthiness? </p><p> They were all eyeing him now. Theo said, -- I've only seen sketches. There are many good points. But I cannot say I've fully matured my opinion. </p><p> -- Really? </p><p> -- Yes sir. I only arrived in the City today. I was preparing to report to Captain Ericsson this evening when your note arrived. </p><p> Barnes said, -- And so you shall; we shall not keep you. We wish you the best of luck in your new post, sir. And to assist you in your efforts . . . </p><p> The envelope was of heavy, calendared, expensive paper. Theo accepted it with raised eyebrows. -- What is this, sir? </p><p> Old Eaker murmured, -- A letter of credit, sir, on Eaker and Callowell -- my firm -- for the sum of two thousand dollars. The Union is in peril, sir. While young stalwarts like my son defend her with their lives, it is only meet we older patriots defend her with our purses. You may draw on it for any expenditure you think fit to advance the cause or make your own efforts easier. </p><p> Theo found himself stammering. -- I must say . . . as I think fit . . . You will require an accounting? </p><p> -- I do not think that will be necessary, Eaker said gravely. </p><p> -- Only a word of caution, Bushnell put in. </p><p> -- A caution, sir? Theo fingered the envelope, still in shock. Two thousand was what a first engineer drew a year. </p><p> -- Rather let us call it advice. Barnes glanced at the others. -- Well-meant counsel from those inclined to be your friends. That is, if you have any brief from the chief engineer or the chief constructor or any other quarter to frustrate Captain Ericsson's efforts in the country's defense, you may find your career prospects shortened. If, on the other hand, you lend him your full assistance, and he meets with the success we expect, you will find them much enhanced. Other opportunities will beckon after the insurrection is put down next summer. Aid him with your seagoing expertise. And let us know -- confidentially, of course -- if you should foresee any problems. </p><p> Theo stood with gloves in one hand, the envelope in the other. Should he tell them he didn't need threats or rewards to do his duty? Or simply bow and withdraw? One would give him a moment's satisfaction. The other, not only two thousand dollars to spend as he wished, but preferment in business when peace returned. These were powerful men. The sort he'd always planned to serve . . . and to become. </p><p> He said quietly, -- My orders are to assist Mister Ericsson in any way poss...</p></p><h2>Flame Tree: Selected Poems</h2><p>Kevin Hart&#39;s poems have been hailed as among the best being written today. He is a visionary writer. His poetry is dual in nature and inspiration, embracing the pain and passion of humanity at the same time as it evokes the immanence of God in the world. It is both radiant and grounded, sensuous and searching, casting both light and shadow on what can be named while tracing the borderlines of what must be left unnamed.</p><p>Kevin Hart is not only one of Australia&#39;s most important poets but a major figure in world poetry. He is a visionary writer who has taken his bearings as much from English Romanticism and European Modernism as from the Bible, Plato and Meister Eckhart. His poetry is at once sensuous and mysterious, visionary yet grounded in the lush, tropical landscapes of Australia. Hart&#39;s poetry is dual in nature and inspiration, embracing the pain and passion of humanity at the same time as it evokes the immanence of God in the world. His double-edged poetry is both radiant and grounded, sensuous and searching, casting both light and shadow on what can be named while tracing the borderlines of what must be left unnamed. It does not betray these borders, but respects their mystery and complexity. As Hart has written: &#34;The best conductor of mystery is clarity. The true bearer of complexity is simplicity.&#34;Kevin Hart was born in 1954 in the village of Ockenden near London, and grew up in London and Brisbane. He has published several books of poetry in Britain, Australia and America, including FLAME TREE: SELECTED POEMS (Bloodaxe Books, 2002) and his latest collection, YOUNG RAIN (Bloodaxe Books, 2009).

Quickly establishing himself as an important young artist, he took part in the renaissance of modern sculpture and public art that unfolded over the following decades. Murray was particularly innovative in his use of industrial fabrication methods to create his pieces and in his deep investigation of landscape as inspiration for abstract sculpture. His synthesis of the rich tradition of landscape painting in Canada and the exciting vision of New York abstract expressionist and color-field painters has resulted in an extraordinary and unique body of work. Murray was awarded the Order of Canada in 2000 and received the Barnett and Annalee Newman Foundation Grant Award for Lifetime Achievement in 2018.</p> <p><em>Robert Murray: Sculpture</em> includes photographs of nearly two hundred works that span the artist's career, seen in galleries, museums, and private collections, at public outdoor exhibitions, in his studios, and in the workshops of his fabricators. Jonathan D. Lippincott's introduction and interview with Murray cover the sculptor's process of working with fabricators and foundries, issues of public art and the siting of sculpture, Murray's early years, his close friendship with Barnett Newman and relationships with other artists, his lifelong interest in flying, and more, insightfully illuminating both the work and the life of this remarkable sculptor. </p><br></p><p><p>Jonathan D.

His other books are <b>What Am I Doing Here</b> and <b>Anatomy of Restlessness</b>, posthumous anthologies of shorter works, and <b>Far Journeys</b>, a collection of his photographs that also includes selections from his travel notebooks.Chatwin is a protean writer ( On the Black Hill , The Songlines ) always capable of surprising and entertaining his readers. In this slim volume, he draws a satirical portrait of life in a Socialist stateand concludes that human nature is the same no matter what political winds are blowing. The last descendent of an old Czech family, the eponymous art dealer Kaspar Utz lives in Prague, where the Russian occupiers allow him to keep his priceless Meissen porcelain collection on condition that he bequeath it to the national museum. To the narrator, Utz represents the quintessential adapter, able to tolerate a repressive government as long as his private life is undisturbed. Obsessed with a passion to preserve these remnants of the bygone days of imperial glory, Utz implies that the figurines are more real, enduring and invulnerable than the gray world of Eastern Europe existing behind the Iron Curtain. But on his death a droll mystery is revealed; the fate of the collection is as much a result of the belated awakening of Utz's romantic nature as it is a joke against the political regime he despised. Befitting his narrative, Chatwin's spare, precise prose takes on a surrealist quality appropriate to the theater of the absurd. 40,000 first printing; $35,000 ad/promo; Literary Guild alternate. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The American Ephemeris for the 20th Century: 1900 to 2000 at Midnight</h2><p>The American Ephemeris for the 20th Century: 1900 to 2000 at Midnigh</p><p></p><h2>Always Time to Die</h2><p><blockquote><p>Former U.S. Senator Quintrell is dead.<br>His son, New Mexico's governor, is preparing his<br>run for the highest political office in the land.</p><p>And dark family secrets are about to explode with the<br> devastating force of a Southwestern earthquake.</p></blockquote><p>An eccentric Quintrell aunt has invited genealogist Carolina "Carly" May to their Taos compound to compile a record of the illustrious family.

He arrived with twenty dollars in his pocket and, enchanted by the extraordinary world he found there, explored the country until he stumbled into the presence of Hari Puri Baba, a yogi in the ancient tradition of the Renunciates of the Ten Names. Hari Puri proceeded to shave the young stranger&#x2019;s head and initiate him into his order. Now called Rampuri, the young man embarked on a discipleship unlike anything he had ever imagined. He had to learn Hindi and Sanskrit, overcome opposition as an outsider, and deal with the battle that raged within him as he attempted to reconcile the Western view of India with the reality of its culture and beliefs. Despite overwhelming odds and the mysterious death of his guru, he stayed the course and has remained in India to this day.<br><br>As Rampuri reveals the teachings he received and describes the rituals and pilgrimages in which he participated, it becomes clear that this is an unprecedented telling of one man&#x2019;s sacred initiation and training and a must-read for any serious seeker.</p><p>Rampuri was born in Chicago and grew up in Beverly Hills. In 1969 he traveled overland to India, where he has lived ever since. In 1970 he met Hari Puri Baba, who became his guru and initiated him, the first foreigner, into Juna Akhara, the ancient order of the Renunciates of the Ten Names. In 1984 he established Hari Puri Ashram in Hardwar, North India, where he continues his practice of the Yoga tradition.

The voyage from Karachi was the final leg of a six-month overland journey that had taken me from Amsterdam to what would become my new home.<br><br>A deck-class ticket bought you a place on the ship, but not a seat, berth, or cabin. You were on your own when it came to claiming a piece of the deck, usually the size of your straw mat or blanket. The two upper decks soon became a multicolored sea of bedding and people. When I first came aboard, Sigi, a young German, led me to a remote corner of the deck, where I could smell incense and there was a kasbah partitioned with pastel silks into passageways and small camps. This, apparently, was the foreigners' quarter.<br><br>We were pilgrims, refugees, children of the revolution! We came from North America, South America, Asia, the Middle East, and every country in Europe. We had encountered one another at every stop along the way&#x2014;Istanbul, Ankara, Konya, Tabriz, Tehran, Mashad, Herat, Kandahar, Kabul, Peshawar, Karachi&#x2014;individuals, groups, and clans, all making the great pilgrimage. Where to? We were on our way home, moving toward the Light, or so we believed.<br><br>"Watch out for thieves," my new friend warned, as we put down our mats at the edge of the little colony. "It's usually the French. One of us must guard our belongings at all times."<br><br>"Pardon," said an orange-robed European with flowing black locks, accompanied by several young women. He resembled one of the Three Musketeers, except for his pointed Aladdin slippers. "You are going to India for the first time?" he asked, introducing himself as Cartouche. "May we join you?"<br><br>"What kinda name . . . ," I started.<br><br>"Egyptian," he said, "from my father's side. My mother is French."<br><br>In what appeared to be flawless Urdu, he instructed the Pakistani coolie where to put each bag, argued over the price, said something that made the man laugh, and then paid him.<br><br>"We wanted to share this journey with spiritual people," Cartouche said, as he explained why they had moved from the Italian section of the deck. Cartouche and the girls spread their bedding next to mine. "You and I must have met before," he said. "Perhaps in a previous life?"<br><br>A man dressed in a green Afghan robe came over to harangue Cartouche in Italian and was the recipient of a long outburst in the same tongue. Cartouche's scowl turned to a smile as he remarked, "I told him to fuck off, if he wanted to remain attached to the material world!"<br><br>Sigi was suspicious. "Why did the Italians force you to move?"<br><br>"They are Greens," replied Cartouche. "You know, Muslims, and they thought it inappropriate for a Hindu holy man to camp beside them. They are making a pilgrimage to the holy places of their Sufi saints before heading down to Goa."<br><br>"I'm going straight to Goa," said Sigi. "A night in Bombay at the Carlton, and the morning boat to paradise." He said that he'd had some kind of problem in Germany, and didn't plan to return there for many years. Everyone seemed to be headed to Goa.<br><br>"This is actually what he wants." Cartouche's eyes flashed as he pulled a drawstring bag out of another drawstring bag out of a shoulder bag. With great reverence he removed a small statue of the god Shiva, wrapped in red silk. "Swat Valley, maybe a thousand years old," he explained. "He wanted to pay me shit! And he's not even a Hindu!"<br><br>"I'm going to find me a nice shack on the beach," said the German, carefully placing his valuables under a makeshift pillow.<br><br>"Me, I want to find the ice palace of the Mother of the World, where the gods and goddesses hang out," crooned one of Cartouche's young women from under her veil. She was high on something.<br><br>"And you, my friend?" Cartouche turned to me with his infectious smile. "Where will you go?"<br><br>I thought for a moment, like a child about to enter an amusement park, before blurting out, "I'm not sure. Maybe Goa . . . but I'm looking for something&#x2014;I'm not sure what yet, but it's something that we've lost in the West. Yeah, I guess I'm also going to India to have my mind blown!"<br><br>"Not enough action in your, uh, San Francisco? That's why you have come?" he asked with raised eyebrows.<br><br>"Well, actually, I think I've sort of been pulled here." I grinned.<br><br>"That's the case with all of us," he said. Cartouche had very old eyes, in contrast to his youthful face and body. He looked about twenty-two years old, a few years older than I, but had the demeanor and maturity of a man at least a generation older.<br><br>I had dropped out of high school. I had questions my teachers wouldn't or couldn't answer. I had other ideas, perhaps immature and incomplete, but compelling. I had lost my faith in them, but not lost faith. I thought of Manifest Destiny as a pack of lies. I wanted to go join up with the American Indians. But they were all dead.<br><br>"Where are you from?" I asked him.<br><br>"Paris," he said.<br><br>"You were there in May, the one before last, for the Revolution?" I asked him.<br><br>"Non, I was in India at the Kumbh Mela, the largest spiritual gathering in the world, with my guru. The real revolution is to transform yourself, not society. If you can succeed, then society will follow. The world is fucked up, corrupted by capitalist elites, but we cannot hope to win any war on the material plane. Finding the Truth is the only way."<br><br>For many young people, the lines that existed between politics, spirituality, and lifestyle were faint, if they existed at all. We were wildly idealistic and naive. I told Cartouche that I wanted to find a treasure in India that would somehow make the world a better place.<br><br>"A better place?" Cartouche asked. "For whom? Is it heaven that you wish to bring to earth, or is it earth you'd like to raise to heaven? If it is the former, you are following a long line of failures. Ask Karl Marx. And my friends who made the Revolution of '68&#x2014;one day they will rule France, but nothing will be any different."<br><br>Cartouche had crossed the line and made it to the other side. He was confident and authoritative. He seemed to know India well, so I asked him if he could give me a list of places to visit.<br><br>"A waste of time," he replied. "You'll find all the right places. That's how India works."<br><br>"And what's with this 'ice palace'?" I asked, feeling a bit stupid. "Come on; is it a real place?"<br><br>"Sure it is," he said, "but you can't go there. Foreigners aren't allowed. It's in the Himalayas, within what they call the inner circle, too close to China. I guess they're afraid of spies."<br><br>"Have you been there?" I asked.<br><br>"Non, but I tried. The police caught me and sent me back down the mountain. My guru had told me that if I would meet him there, he would give me a magic potion that would let me live forever."<br><br>The small group that had been listening to our conversation dwindled until Cartouche and I were alone, watching the moon sail across the sky. He enchanted me with more stories about his experiences in India. For as long as I could remember, I had been fascinated by what, in those days, we called the "occult." I wanted to meet real shamans and wizards. I believed they existed, but I needed proof. I wanted to find ancient manuscripts containing secret knowledge, mantras, and spells. But that was all surface stuff. I desperately needed some answers. There were the basic questions concerning the meaning of life, death, life after death, and Truth, and there were other less formulated questions that had arisen after I had taken mind-altering substances. In America I had been unable to find a Don Juan to guide me, but my omnivorous reading of the Upanishads, Vedanta, and books on Theosophy led me to believe that I could indeed find these answers in India.<br><br>"Don't waste your time going to Goa, hanging out with hippies. In India there are real masters who can teach the Path and help us understand who we are. The first thing you have to know before you begin your search is that there is no search; you are already there at that place where you hope to arrive, but it takes time to discover that. So, with that in mind, go and search," he said.<br><br>"But where should I start?" I asked<br><br>"Hey, enlightenment is not subject to the illusions of time and space. The possibility of transforming consciousness lies only in the here and now. But I'll give you some addresses," he replied.<br><br>He drew the Sanskrit character om at the top of one of the pages in my notebook, explaining that this symbol would ensure the success of my quest. Then he wrote the names of a few temples and holy places and of some of the big gurus. He explained which temples were dedicated to the Mother Goddess, which to Shiva, and which to the blue god, Krishna. He rambled on about the claims and feats of various teachers, including Satya Sai Baba, who could remember his past lives and materialize objects out of thin air, and then gave me the names and addresses of some sadhus, characterizing each as he wrote.<br><br>The last name was of a sadhu in Rajasthan. "Hari Puri Baba is a bit more modern. He speaks English, which my baba doesn't. I studied with my guru the traditional way, in Hindi and Sanskrit. Still, they say Hari Puri Baba is a gyani, a knower. They say he knows how to read the world." Cartouche laughed. "Perhaps you would prefer to follow the Path in your mother tongue.

It was a favor for his old friend Judge Horace Woolner. It was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to serve as special prosecutor in a case against a man sworn to uphold the law, Marshall Goodwin, the chief deputy district attorney accused of having his former wife murdered. It was an opportunity Joseph Antonelli couldn't walk away from.<br><br>But Antonelli is walking into more than he bargained for. The Goodwin case renews his appetite for the practice of law, and although Antonelli is determined to remain on the side of justice, there are many shades between right and wrong. And Antonelli may be over his head when Russell Gray, an urbane, worldly, and wealthy man from a prominent Portland family, is found murdered in his living room. Horace Woolner's wife stands accused of the crime. With justice and love on the line, the stakes couldn't be higher. In this stunning look at our legal system and our hearts, D. W. Buffa delivers on the promise of The Defense and takes us into the dark recesses of our courtrooms and our souls, where there are no easy answers.<br></p><p>If you liked D.W. Buffa's debut legal thriller <i>The Defense</i>, you should love this sequel. It's virtually the same blend of courtroom razzle-dazzle and backstage manipulation, beautifully written, and studded with deep philosophical thoughts. Joe Antonelli, the ace Portland, Oregon, defense attorney who could get even the most guilty of villains off the hook, has been so shattered by the events of the first book that he's retired, sitting in the house he inherited and reading lots of classic literature. Then his best friend, Judge Horace Woolner, arm-twists him into coming back to work--this time as a special prosecutor, investigating the distinct possibility that the city's deputy district attorney hired a man to kill his wife. The case, of course, is fraught with political overtones. And no sooner has Joe done this dirty job than another disturbing case pops up for him to handle: Judge Woolner's wife is charged with shooting a man who might have been her lover.<p> Buffa, a former professor of political theory and Portland criminal lawyer, is also a world-class writer who knows how to plant vital evidence and then snatch it away or turn it on its head. He also is sly enough to realize that Antonelli might become a bit of a prig if left unchecked, so he drops in the occasional little jest among the deep thoughts from time to time. In an elevator, Joe quotes a line from Thomas Hobbes to Judge Woolner: </p><blockquote> "Life is 'a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death.'" "Ceaseth," Horace repeated, laughing at the way it sounded. "You have to understand," I said, as the elevator door slid open, "in the seventeenth century everyone talked with a lisp." </blockquote> <i>--Dick Adler</i>defense attorney, Joseph Antonelli has made his reputation by winning at any cost, watching the wheels of justice turn, outguessing every turn and every lurch. Now he&#x2019;s come out of retirement to win again. Only this time his job is not to defend, it is to prosecute&#x2013;to send a deputy district attorney to death row for the crime of murder for hire. But in a torrid case of violence, adultery, and betrayal, lies compound lies, truths defy belief, and finally, one murder leads to another. Suddenly Antonelli knows that in this case the wheels of justice are warped by money and power. And putting the right person away isn&#x2019;t just a matter of law, it&#x2019;s a matter of survival. . . .<br><br></p><h2>The Amazing World of Gumball: Scrimmage Scramble (4)</h2><p>When Anais goes to Darwin and Gumball for help in learning about sports to prove she can beat the new exchange student, things get out of hand when the whole school gets involved in a fake sport that her brothers totally -no, really- know how to play.&nbsp;<br><br>Anais is having a hard time dealing with a new exchange student, and decides to challenge him in a sport...only, she doesn&#x2019;t know how to play any sports.

The small plane dropped suddenly, seemed to fall from the sky, then levelled for a moment before tilting like a fairground ride. She opened her eyes to see a grey cliff ahead of them. It was close enough for her to make out the white streaks of bird muck and last season&#x2019;s nests. Below, the sea was boiling. Spindrift and white froth caught by the gale-force winds spun over the surface of the water.</p><p>Why doesn&#x2019;t the pilot do something? Why is Jimmy just sitting there, waiting for us all to die?</p><p>She imagined the impact as the plane hit the rock, twisted metal and twisted bodies. No hope at all of survival. I should have written a will. Who will care for Cassie? Then she realized this was the first time in her life she&#x2019;d been scared for her own physical safety and was overcome by a mindless panic that scrambled her brain and stopped her thinking.</p><p>Then the plane lifted slightly, seemed just to clear the edge of the cliff. Perez was pointing out familiar landmarks: the North Haven, the field centre at the North Light, Ward Hill. It seemed to Fran that the pilot was still struggling to keep the aircraft level and that Perez was hoping to distract her as they bucked and swivelled to make a landing. Then they were down, bumping along the airstrip.</p><p>Neil the pilot sat quite still for a moment, his hands resting on the joystick. Fran thought then he&#x2019;d been almost as scared as she had.</p><p>&#x2018;Great job,&#x2019; Perez said.</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, well.&#x2019; Neil gave a brief grin. &#x2018;We have to practise for the ambulance flights. But I did think at one point we&#x2019;d have to turn back.&#x2019; He added more urgently: &#x2018;Out you get, the pair of you. I&#x2019;ve a planeload of visitors to take out and the forecast is that it&#x2019;ll get worse later. I don&#x2019;t want to be stranded here all week.&#x2019;</p><p>A small group of people waited by the airstrip, their backs to the wind, struggling to remain upright. Perez and Fran&#x2019;s bags were already unloaded and Neil was waving for the waiting passengers to come on board. Fran found she was shaking now. It had felt suddenly cold after leaving the stuffy cabin of the small plane, but she knew this was also a response to her fear. And to her anxiety about meeting the waiting people, Perez&#x2019;s family and friends. This place, Fair Isle, was a part of who he was. He&#x2019;d grown up here and his family had lived here for generations. What would they make of her?</p><p>It would be, she thought, like the worst sort of job interview, and instead of arriving calm and composed, ready with a smile &#x2013; usually she could do charm as well as anyone she knew &#x2013; the terror of the flight remained with her and had turned her to a shivering, inarticulate wreck.</p><p>She was saved the need to perform immediately because Neil had loaded his passengers on to the plane and was taxiing to the end of the airstrip to prepare for the return trip to Tingwall on the Shetland mainland. The noise of the engines was very close and too loud for them to have an easy conversation. There was a momentary pause, then the surge of the engines again and the plane rattled past them and lifted into the air. Already it looked as frail and small as a child&#x2019;s toy, tossed about by the strong wind. It turned over their heads and disappeared north, seeming more stable now. Around her Fran sensed a collective relief. She thought she hadn&#x2019;t been overreacting about the dangers of the flight. It wasn&#x2019;t a southern woman&#x2019;s hysteria. This wasn&#x2019;t an easy place to live.</p>&nbsp;BLUE LIGHTNING. Copyright � 2010 by Ann Cleeves. All rights reserved.

The book was part of a performative talk given by the French conceptual artist Philippe Thomas (195195) at the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris on 23 March 1987, and repeated a year later at the Mus�e de Grenoble. What audience members only realised upon leaving the auditorium was that the talk they had just witnessed was minutely scripted down to Thomas&#39; smallest gestures and pauses in the book itself. Thomas thus blurs definitions of artist&#39;s talk&#39;, &#39;performance&#39;, &#39;transcript&#39; and &#39;book&#39;, producing instead a play on words, and speech acts. Consistent with Thomas&#39; desire to separate the author&#39;s name from actual authorship, the book is attributed to Daniel Bosser, the collector who acquired the piece.</p><p></p><h2>Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress</h2><p>In 1971 Mao&#39;s campaign against the intellectuals is at its height. Our narrator and his best friend, Luo, distinctly unintellectual but guilty of being the sons of doctors, have been sent to a remote mountain village to be &#39;reeducated&#39;. The kind of education that takes place among the peasants of Phoenix Mountain involves carting buckets of excrement up and down precipitous, foggy paths, but the two seventeen-year-olds have a violin and their sense of humour to keep them going. Further distraction is provided by the attractive daughter of the local tailor, possessor of a particularly fine pair of feet. Their true re-education starts, however, when they discover a comrade&#39;s hidden stash of classics of great nineteenth-century Western literature - Balzac, Dickens, Dumas, Tolstoy and others, in Chinese translation. They need all their ingenuity to get their hands on the forbidden books, but when they do their lives are turned upside down. And not only their lives: after listening to their dangerously seductive retellings of Balzac, the Little Seamstress will never be the same again. Without betraying the truth of what happened, Dai Sijie transforms the bleak events of China&#39;s Cultural Revolution into an enchanting and unexpected story about the resilience of the human spirit and the magical power of great storytelling.</p><p>&#x201c;An unexpected miracle&#x2013;a delicate, and often hilarious, tale.&#x201d; <i>&#x2014;Los Angeles Times Book Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;A funny, touching, sly and altogether delightful novel . . . about the power of art to enlarge our imaginations.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The</i> <i>Washington Post Book World<br><br></i> &#x201c;Poetic and affecting. . . .

An immediate international bestseller, it tells the story of two hapless city boys exiled to a remote mountain village for re-education during China&#39;s infamous Cultural Revolution. There the two friends meet the daughter of the local tailor and discover a hidden stash of Western classics in Chinese translation.

Eugene Ehrlich has created a reference work that defines French phrases and aphorisms both literally and colloquially; employs a unique and foolproof guide to their pronunciation; adds a brief and often amusing explanation that fixes each phrase in the reader's mind; and indexes everything so extensively that each idea is easy to find. An entertaining read as well as an impeccable reference guide by one of America's most cherished wordsmiths.</p></p><p>You may have taken French for Tourists, but what do you do when you're positive that guy just said "the mustard went up my nose"? Turn to page 170 of <i>Les Bons Mots</i> and you'll learn that he blew his cool. Written by word maven Eugene Ehrlich (author of <i>The Highly Selective Dictionary for the Extraordinarily Literate</i>), this cleverly written guide to everyday, idiomatic French gives pronunciation, common translations, and brief discussions of over a thousand words and phrases, most of which you'll never see in a pocket phrasebook.<p> From <i>� bas</i> (down with) to <i>zut alors</i> (darn it!), you'll find oddly used words, figures of speech, and oft-quoted lines from French historical figures.

A little study and practice with this fun book and you'll never hear "<i>il �corche le fran�ais</i>" again.

In capital letters because it is also the name of his book, A Lucky Dog. You have to read the book to know how lucky is Owney, the U.S. Rail Mail Mascot. But to understand Dirk's good luck you have to know that after 30 years as a screenwriter, he got his first two children's books published at age 68. He says, like so many writers before him, persistence and hard work bring fruitful results. Proof of his Lucky Dogness. <p>As a writer of books for young people, he is currently working on his next book, Jack London's Dog, this book explores the notion of memory and heroism through the meeting of London and the dog who would become Buck in Jack London's Call Of The Wild. </p><p>In his other life, Mr. Wales is a writer and director of film and video having made more than 200 documentary, children's films and educational film'/video and won more than 100 films/video festival awards in national and international competitions. </p><p>Mr. Wales grew up in Los Angeles and studies at Stanford University and UCLA. He lives in Chicago and Santa Fe.</p>Gr. 1-4. Wales' account of the U.S. Postal Service's first, and probably only, canine mascot will strike a chord with animal lovers and inspire inquiries into history and geography. In 1887, on a cold, rainy night in Albany, New York, a postal worker takes pity on a shivering dog that has taken shelter in the depot. Although it's against the rules, the supervisor allows "Owney" to stay. One day, the dog jumps aboard a mail train and discovers he likes riding the rails. News of his adventures, which ultimately include a trip around the world, spreads as he travels, and people give him baggage tags from the places he visits. The overuse of exclamation points aside, the narrative is clear and straightforward, and the scratchy, earth-toned illustrations aptly convey both the scraggliness of the stray and the nineteenth-century backdrop of the story. A satisfying tale, all the more pleasing for being true. <i>Diane Foote</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Metaxas draws readers into this very British retelling with wily, wild caricatures read by the Monty Python star. When the giant comes home and smells Jack (who is hiding in the oven), his wife scolds, ```Nonsense, dearie. . . You must be dreaming. Unless, of course, it's the scraps of that English boy you had for yesterday's dinner . . . .''' However, there are times when the text's affect is better oral than written (keep in mind that this is a book-cassette set); in one instance, the phrase, ``and he climbed'' is repeated six times. For listeners, the repetition is emphatic; but for readers, it's overkill. The illustrations are effective. Scuzzy, pot-bellied, and dim, the giant is so disgusting that no one minds that he's robbed. Related in squiggly pen-and-ink line drawings with watercolor washes that catch the spirit of both Ardizzone and Galdone, Jack's adventure is as satisfying as ever. A good choice for folklore shelves, and a better one for audio collections. --Carolyn Noah, Central Mass.

With help from a wealthy American family and friendship and support from a British gentleman, Nora nevertheless finds herself caught in a conflict of the heart.</p><p>Michael Burke, a strong, dedicated Irish policeman, desperately wants to keep his promise to his best friend Morgan Fitzgerald to marry Nora and protect her.

The familiar is represented--Vulcan and Venus, Romulus and Remus, Orion and Diana--as well as the less familiar--Ganymede, the golden bough, the twelve books of divination, and Juno's guardian geese. Andrew Sachs is a commanding narrator, delighted in the lore he shares. As god or goddess, he conveys imperiousness, wisdom, jealousy, and conspiracy. As mortal, he shares human frailties, energy, and fortitude. Thanks to Sachs's facile narration, the listener realizes how little human nature has changed; the escapades of Roman gods and mortals are familiar to us all. A.R. � AudioFile 2000, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i>Grade 3-5-This companion to McCaughrean and Clark's Greek Myths (McElderry, 1993) is equally enjoyable. Fifteen tales introducing the Olympians and telling of Romulus and Remus, Philemon and Baucis, or the Sibylline prophecies lead nicely from one to the next, explaining Roman beliefs of fate and destiny in the telling. McCaughrean does this in her short, dramatized text by posing questions or suggesting motivation in a way that almost oversimplifies, or treats the subject casually. But she has accomplished an appealing and approachable introduction to Roman mythology that will make readers want to seek out more. Clark's watercolor-and-pencil illustrations also lend a light touch to the stories, suffusing every page with color in spot or full-page art. On the title page of each story, she imitates Roman art in an illustrated bar, and gives similar stylistic effects in page-number borders, but the bulk of her pictures are in her own appealing style that matches McCaughrean's tone beautifully. Brief notes on the myths make cultural references and hint at the wealth of more stories to be found, though, as there is no bibliography, readers will have to find them on their own. This attractive introduction should whet their appetites.<br><i>Nina Lindsay, Oakland Public Library, CA </i><br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crystals: A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Harnessing the Healing Energy of Crystals for Health, Wealth, Love and Abundance (Power Healing Stones, Crystal Energy Fields)</h2><p><b></b><br><b>&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2605; Harness the Healing Energy of Crystals for Health, Wealth, Love and Abundance! &#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2605;<br></b><br><b></b><br><b>What can this book do for you?<br></b><br>When you read Crystals: A Beginner's Guide to Harnessing the Healing Energy of Crystals for Health, Wealth, Love and Abundance you'll learn exactly what crystal healing is, and how it works.<br><br>It's about time that you tap into these amazing sources of powerful energy for Health, Wealth, Love and Abundance!<br><br><b>This Book Will Guide and Teach you many Ancient Secrets and Powerful techniques such as:<br></b><br>� The Most Powerful crystals for Love, Romance, Passion and Emotional Connection<br><br>� The Best Stones for Attracting and holding Abundance<br><br>� The Ultimate Stones for Rapid Manifestation<br><br>� The Most Powerful Crystals for Health, Healing not just the physical, but also the Spiritual<br><br>� Crystal Pairing to Enhance Energy Fields<br><br>� How Chakras Relate To Crystals and How to use this to your Advantage<br><br>� Crystal Grids to Magnify the Properties of the precious Stones<br><br>And Much More!<br><br><b>Download this book right away and access the many benefits of these Enlightening Stones!<br></b><br><b>&#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2605;Take Action and transform your LIFE! &#x2605;&#x2606;&#x2605;<br></b><br>You'll be so glad you did!<br><br></p><p></p><h2>Warship 2018</h2><p><p><i>Warship 2018</i> is devoted to the design, development, and service history of the world's combat ships.

Throughout <i>Proust and the Sense of Time,</i> Kristeva draws on Proust's notebooks and manuscripts, pointing out significant variations in the different versions of his work.

This Swiss-based dynamo is also known as one of the pioneers of three dimensional graffiti art. The link between these different artistic or design modes is a pictorial language that is based on the reduction of images and ideas to the essential - black ink on white surfaces. In order to preserve the character of his work and to create an object that is more than just a direct documentation of his work, the book was constructed with paper stock similar to that of his sketchbooks and all of his work printed exclusively using black ink on white paper. The book is organized into three main organizing chapters: Graffiti, Sketches, and Illustrations. Graffiti focuses on Styles &amp; Characters, 3-D Styles and Living Letters, Sketches is divided into the categories Animals and People and the last section, Illustrations is devoted to Portraits and the commercial Grafics work that appears under the label Atalier.</p><p></p><h2>The Wise Woman and Her Secret</h2><p>Although many try to force from the wise woman the secret of her wisdom, the truth is made clear only to a young girl who shows the capacity for wandering and wondering.</p><p>Grade 1-2-- A story about a woman and the villagers who demand to know the ``secret'' of her wisdom. They, of course, want quick answers to difficult questions. Her only response is to allow them to look around; they ransack her place, but leave unsatisfied. Only small Jenny, who lingers, wonders, and expresses curiosity, at last discovers the secret--never stated outright--which is that wisdom comes from savoring the world and the moment. Of course, she grows up to be a wise woman herself. A text with profound implication is without pictures that are equally intense and mysterious. Graves's paintings are extremely pretty and unremittingly romantic, embellished with continually recurring curves in an art nouveau manner: tendrils of vines and hair; spiraling folds of clothing; bending lines of lip, eye, and cheek.

Possibly the most famous Stoic Philosopher is Marcus Aurelius, whose &#34;Meditations&#34; was written, not to be read as a philosophic treatise, but rather as a personal journal, complete with seemingly random entries and no apparent structure. Moreover, it is clear from his &#34;Meditations&#34; that Marcus Aurelius was greatly influenced by the teachings of Epictetus. In fact, according to Aulus Gellius, Herodes Atticus (who was Marcus Aurelius&#39; teacher at the time) told Marcus Aurelius that Epictetus was the greatest of all the Stoic philosophers, which is quite convenient for us since most of the writings of earlier Stoics (such as Zeno of Cilium, Clearness and Chrysippus) have been lost.</p><p></p><h2>Japan: An Environmental History (Environmental History and Global Change, 6)</h2><p>The lush green mountainous archipelago of today supports a population of over 127 million people and one of the most advanced economies in the world. How has this come about? At what environmental cost? Conrad Totman, one of the world&#39;s foremost scholars on Japan, here provides a comprehensive and detailed account of the country&#39;s environmental history, from its beginnings to the present day. What makes the Japanese story particularly instructive is that the country&#39;s boundaries are uncommonly clear and the nature, timing, and extent of external influences on its history are unusually identifiable. The Japanese experience, therefore, not only yields important insights into the processes of environmental history, it offers important lessons for the wider environmental history of the planet.</p><p>Conrad Totman is Professor Emeritus in Japanese History, Yale University. Acknowledged as the leading western authority on Japanese environmental history, his books include Japan before Perry, The Green Archipelago, Early Modern Japan, and A History of Japan (3rd edition, 2010)&#x201c;This is the premier book for readers in and outside academia to gain a comprehensive view of human interaction with the environment on the Japanese archipelago, and a perspective that is beyond the anthropocentric historiography.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Canadian Journal of History/Annales canadiennes d'histoire</i></p><h2>I Need to Know Answers to Questions About God</h2><p>Used.

Cruising down Montana&#39;s scenic highways, it&#39;s easy to forget that traveling from here to there once was a genuine adventure. The state&#39;s major routes evolved from ancient Native American trails into four-lane expressways in a little over a century. That story is one of difficult, groundbreaking and sometimes poor engineering decisions, as well as a desire to make a journey faster, safer and more comfortable. It all started in 1860, when John Mullan hacked a wagon road over the formidable Rocky Mountains to Fort Benton. It continued until the last section of interstate highway opened to traffic in 1988. Montana Department of Transportation historian Jon Axline charts a road trip through the colorful and inspiring history of trails, roads and superhighways in Big Sky Country.</p><p>Jon Axline has been the historian at the Montana Department of Transportation since 1990.

In the 30 years he has spent behind the microphone, Ozzy has built a legacy that will never be surpassed in the music industry. From his stellar days with the influential Black Sabbath to his solo career, there are few heavy metal artists that even come close to bolstering a record like Ozzy&#x2019;s. At the age of 53, Ozzy now finds himself as popular as ever, starring in his own TV show -- the MTV reality show The Osbournes that attracted 8 million viewers in the U.S. for its first season -- as well as hosting the Ozzfest, an annual tour of heavy metal heavyweights which draws millions of fans throughout the United States and Europe. The book presents the Ozzy we have all grown to know in recent years through his most personal medium: his songs. Every classic Sabbath song as well as each of Ozzy&#x2019;s solo hits are put under the microscope, giving the reader a view of Ozzy that few have ever before seen: that of an intelligent, caring, and brilliant songwriter. 120 color and black-and-white photographs are included in this intimate look at the lyrics behind the most notorious man in rock and roll history. Also discussed are the alcohol and drug-fueled controversies in Ozzy&#x2019;s career such as his infamous on-stage antics, death-defying addiction, and numerous troubles with the law, including an attempted murder charge involving his longtime wife, Sharon. Some say his music has the power to inspire, others say it leads to suicide. Either way one thing is for sure: On or off stage, there will never be another Ozzy.</p><p></p><h2>Raised by Wolves</h2><p>At the age of four, Bryn watched a rogue werewolf brutally murder her parents. Alone in the world, she was rescued and taken in by the mysterious Callum, the alpha of his werewolf pack. Now fifteen, Bryn&#x2019;s been raised as a human among werewolves, adhering to pack rule (mostly). Little fazes her. <br>&nbsp;<br>But the pack&#x2019;s been keeping a secret, and when Bryn goes exploring against Callum&#x2019;s direct orders, she finds Chase, a newly turned teen Were locked in a cage. Terrifying memories of the attack on her mom and dad come flooding back. Bryn needs answers, and she needs Chase to get them. Suddenly, all allegiances to the pack no longer matter.&nbsp; It&#x2019;s Bryn and Chase against the werewolf world, whatever the consequences.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>An exciting new paranormal adventure, with a heroine that rivals Buffy, <i>Raised by Wolves</i> will leave you howling for more.</b></p><p><strong>Melissa Marr Reviews <em>Raised by Wolves</em></strong> <p><b>Melissa Marr is the author of the bestselling <i>Wicked Lovely</i> series: <em>Wicked Lovely</em>, <em>Ink Exchange</em>, <em>Fragile Eternity</em>, and <em>Radiant Shadows</em>. Read her review of <em>Raised by Wolves</em>:</b></p> <p> </p> <p>In <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, Jennifer Lynn Barnes uses her real world knowledge of pack behavior as the basis of an action-packed, intense, romantic story.</p> <p>Real wolves are pack animals: hierarchy and dominance matter. Whereas most of us have no access to untamed pack mammals, Jennifer is an exception. In her Ph.D. work at Yale in medical science and psychiatry, she journeys regularly to Cayo Santiago, an island populated solely by more than 1000 free ranging rhesus macaques to study their behavior.</p> <p>Like wolves, rhesus monkeys are smart, potentially aggressive animals with a hierarchical structure within their troops. Like wolves, they can be both very beautiful and very dangerous. (Their fangs are the size of your pinkie finger.) On these research trips, Barnes and several other researchers co-exist with at least five troops of monkeys with their own hierarchies and territories. As such, Barnes has been a human living among pack animals who are stronger, who use non-verbal communication, who function on instinct rather than logic. She is, in essence, a young woman who has had to learn some of the same lessons as her protagonist, Bryn.</p> <p>In <em>Raised by Wolves</em>, Bryn is a young woman who faces challenges every day as a human surrounded by male-dominated werewolves. She was taken under the care of the Pack Alpha, Callum, after her family was killed in front of her when she was a small child. Callum&#x2019;s affection and over-protectiveness are both invaluable and stifling. Her life is teetering on that line between cherished and smothered, and while she logically understands the rules, her instinct is not to follow. She is a natural leader who is fiercely loyal, passionate, courageous, and willing to test the rules.</p> <p>And testing the rules is exactly what Bryn must do when she finds out that the pack--her pack, her family--has been holding a prisoner: irresistible newly made teen werewolf, Chase. As Bryn risks everything with and for Chase, she finds her life in danger from those she thought she could trust, strangers from her past, and her own actions.</p> <p>Despite the intense connection Chase and Bryn have, this isn&#x2019;t only a romance. Bryn--with the help of Chase, Devon, and Lake (a very awesome female werewolf)--engages in a conflict that challenges Pack order. As is inevitable in such situations, there are consequences, injuries, and loss. The mature sensibility in both the chemistry between characters and the action-driven plot make this book a crossover for adult paranormal readers, especially fans of adult books by Rachel Vincent, Patricia Briggs, and Kelley Armstrong.</p> <p>Jennifer has taken her experience with pack behavior and added a love of strong heroines (a la <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em>) and her strong sense of romance. The result is a story that <em>Raised by Wolves</em> is, quite simply, the most compelling YA werewolf book out there.</p>Jennifer Lynn Barnes was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma.

Like them, his imagery has reached far beyond the realm of art to impact on our culture in the broadest terms, so that we see early twentieth-century America <i>through</i> his work, as much as within it. The painter Charles Burchfield attributed Hopper&#x2019;s success to his &#x201c;bold individualism,&#x201d; declaring that &#x201c;in him we have regained that sturdy American independence which Thomas Eakins gave us.&#x201d; Hopper&#x2019;s art was profoundly of its time, both in its expression of the subtle melancholies of modern life and in its deeply cinematic qualities--perhaps Hopper&#x2019;s greatest gift was his treatment of light--to which directors from Alfred Hitchcock to Wim Wenders have paid homage.<br>This volume presents a definitive Hopper monograph. Published for a massive retrospective at the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid, and the Grand Palais in Paris, it approaches Hopper&#x2019;s relatively small oeuvre in two sections. The first covers the artist&#x2019;s formative years from approximately 1900 to 1924, examining a selection of sketches, paintings, drawings, illustrations, prints and watercolors, which are considered alongside works by painters that influenced Hopper, such as Winslow Homer, Robert Henri, John Sloan, Edgar Degas and Walter Sickert. The second section considers the years from 1925 onwards, addressing his mature output through chronological but thematic groupings. Comprehensive in its scope, with a wealth of color reproductions, <i>Hopper</i> is the last word on the artist.</p><p>Ottinger considers sketches, paintings, drawings, illustrations, prints, and watercolors; all are superbly reproduced. Hopper's subject matter is considered in depth, including many interpretations by positive and negative critics...

Pritchard sees Frost whole, demonstrating that Frost&#39;s life was indeed a literary one and that the essential fact about it was the poetry that came from it. Lawrance Thompson&#39;s controversial three-volume biography of Frost, published during the 1960s, lead many readers to believe that Frost was selfish, jealous, petty, and ruthlessly manipulative of others. While it doesn&#39;t attempt to revive the image of Frost as a benign, white-haired sage, this book presents him in a strikingly different light. In Pritchard&#39;s view, both Frost&#39;s life and his work offer an example of a powerful imagination and of human energies extravagant and compelling.</p><p></p><h2>The High Tide of American Conservatism: Davis, Coolidge, and the 1924 Election</h2><p>Historians have generally failed to understand the significance of the election of 1924, the last time both major political parties each nominated a bona fide conservative candidate. <p><i>The High Tide of American Conservatism</i> casts new light on both the election and the two candidates, John W. Davis and Calvin Coolidge. Both nominees articulately expounded a similar philosophy of limited government and maximum individual freedom; and both men were exemplary public servants. The enduring consequence of this election was the philosophical divergence of the two parties--Democrats leftward and Republicans rightward. As the proper role of government in a free society continues to be a topic of heated, partisan debate, every American--conservative or liberal--will benefit from an understanding of the 1924 election. Conservatives will recognize the link between Coolidge and Reagan and the modern Republican Party, and they will rejoice to discover a new conservative titan, John W. Davis.</p></p><p><b>Garland S.

Here is a well-researched, well-structured narrative of classic conservative principles in action at the highest levels of politics. Along the way we get thoughtful pen-portraits of two great American gentlemen, men of the highest honor and integrity, both of whom believed, in the words of Coolidge, that 'unless there abides in [the people] the spirit of industry and thrift, of sacrifice and self-denial, of courage and enterprise, and a belief in the reality of truth and justice, all the efforts of the Government will be in vain.''' --<br><b>John Derbyshire</b>, <i>National Review</i><br><br>''Many conservatives believe the summit of their beliefs began and ended with the sainted Reagan. Not true. As Garland S. Tucker III shows in The High Tide of American Conservatism,' in 1924 both presidential candidates, Calvin Coolidge and John Davis, campaigned for limited government, reduced taxes and low tariffs. The Republican Coolidge won in a landslide, in part because the Democrats were in the process of disowning a relatively conservative tradition dating back 40 years in favor of the new progressive politics of Franklin Roosevelt. Coolidge, arguably our least-known good president, served two terms that coincided with strong economic growth enabled in part by steep, across-the-board tax cuts. In the decades that followed, liberal historians tried, with success, to discredit and bury the economic conservatism of the 1920s. The concerns of this important period largely disappeared from the political conversation. But now they're back, thanks to the tea-party movement. Anyone seeking clarity about what's at stake in the run-up to 2012 needs to know what happened to our politics in 1924. It wasn't complicated, it was very exciting and it worked. And Garland S. Tucker III's book is a perfect guide.'' --<br><b>Daniel Henninger</b>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>Well-told tale of one of the most extraordinary and long forgotten Presidential elections in American history.

We do not sell ebooks, print on demand, or other reproduced materials. Each item you see here is individually described and imaged. We welcome further inquiries.</p><p>Arthur Conan Doyle's <i>Study in Scarlet</i> is the first published story involving the legendary Sherlock Holmes, arguably the world's best-known detective, and the first narrative by Holmes's Boswell, the unassuming Dr. Watson, a military surgeon lately returned from the Afghan War. Watson needs a flat-mate and a diversion. Holmes needs a foil. And thus a great literary collaboration begins.<p> Watson and Holmes move to a now-famous address, 221B Baker Street, where Watson is introduced to Holmes's eccentricities as well as his uncanny ability to deduce information about his fellow beings. Somewhat shaken by Holmes's egotism, Watson is nonetheless dazzled by his seemingly magical ability to provide detailed information about a man glimpsed once under the streetlamp across the road. </p><p> Then murder. Facing a deserted house, a twisted corpse with no wounds, a mysterious phrase drawn in blood on the wall, and the buffoons of Scotland Yard--Lestrade and Gregson--Holmes measures, observes, picks up a pinch of this and a pinch of that, and generally baffles his faithful Watson. Later, Holmes explains: "In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backward.... There are few people who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result." Holmes is in that elite group. </p><p> Conan Doyle quickly learned that it was Holmes's deductions that were of most interest to his readers. The lengthy flashback, while a convention of popular fiction, simply distracted from readers' real focus. It is when Holmes and Watson gather before the coal fire and Holmes sums up the deductions that led him to the successful apprehension of the criminal that we are most captivated. Subsequent Holmes stories--<i>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The Return of Sherlock Holmes</i>, and <i>The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes</i>--rightly plunge the twosome directly into the middle of a baffling crime, piling mystery upon mystery until Holmes's denouement once more leaves the dazzled Watson murmuring, "You are wonderful, Holmes!"

These exquisitely designed books, with their magnificent words and glorious pictures, are a pleasure to read - and re-read. The classics have never looked so good!When orphan Mary Lennox arrives from India to live with her uncle, everyone at Misselthwaite Manor thinks her a most disagreeable child. Then one day she discovers a secret garden, locked and hidden for ten years. With the help of Dickon and her spoilt, invalid cousin, Colin, Mary brings the garden back to life; and as she does, the mystery behind it is revealed. An instant classic, &#34;The Secret Garden&#34; has been cherished by generations of readers since its publication in 1911. Beautifully illustrated by Inga Moore.</p><p>Mistress Mary is quite contrary until she helps her garden grow. Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate.

The book also features a number of historic and modern recipes&#x2014;tracing the first official pancake recipe to a sixteenth-century Dutch cook&#x2014;and is accompanied by a rich selection of illustrations.<br><i>Pancake </i>is a witty and erudite history of a well-known favorite and will ensure that the pancake will never be flattened under the shadow of better known foods.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Ken Albala </b>is professor of history at the University of the Pacific in California.

His personal musings on the definition of the pancake often mirror a one-man, Socratic approach to problem-solving. Though the questions are posed internally, Albala is able to intelligently convey the results of his reflections to his audience, and the reader instantly becomes a willing party to the author's pursuit of the elusive pancake. . . .

The story of their birth, however, goes back much farther. This book chronicles the amazing history of the California Gold Rush, which brought hundreds of thousands of hopefuls to the rugged Wild West of the United States. Through that hope, two brothers stumbled across the greatest silver find in history, in what we now know as the State of Nevada. In the 1860s it was the birthplace of a mining industry that inspired the dreams of thousands and the creation of a camp that today is Carson City, Nevada, where eventually the U.S. Mint would start a branch and the famous &#34;CC&#34; Morgan dollars would be struck. Coins dealers and published researchers Adam Crum, Selby Ungar, and Jeff Oxman tell the story and present a rich study of each Carson City Morgan dollar, with detailed analysis for collectors, investors, and historians alike.

Its complex shell-like roof structures echo Gothic arches in section, but the building breaks with all precedent in its three-dimensional form. Finding a practical solution to the construction of these roofs occupied the architect and the engineer Ove Arup for many years, necessitating considerable experimentation with pre-cast concrete technology. Disputes with his client led to Utzon&#39;s withdrawal from the project, and the Opera House looked for a time as if it might be a white elephant. At last, after a 16-year gestation, it opened in 1973 having already become an Australian national icon.</p><p></p><h2>The RVer's Bible: Everything You Need to Know About Choosing, Using, &amp; Enjoying Your RV</h2><p>Covers all aspects of RV living from choosing an RV and towing vehicles, to basic maintenance and cooking on the road</p><p>Sunny Baker has successfully run her own home-based writing and consulting business since 1983. Along with her late husband, Kim Baker, she is the co-author of more than twenty lifestyle, travel, business and computer books. Sunny took her first RV trip in 1976 and has been living part time in RVs ever since. She is a regular contributor to <i>Road Trip</i> magazine.In this perky repository of RV (i.e., recreational vehicle) info, precious little is said of such plebeian concerns as fuel efficiency. Rather, the Bakers emphasize enjoying life once you have cast the die for such a gas-and-road hog. Oh, frugality is a concern, but mostly in the chapters on buying your land yacht and keeping it in running trim. Commonsense nuggets appear throughout (e.g., "Ask for discounts on extended stays"), and the Bakers strive to advise on such mundane operating matters as checking air pressure in the inside tire on a "dually," as well as on larger lifestyle issues, such as what the various "classes" of RVs offer in shower space and the all-important walk-room. So doing, they successfully provide a highly readable, comprehensive, and well-organized one-stop resource on practically any concern RVers might have. This could be the classic RVer's sourcebook. <i>Mike Tribby</i></p><h2>Murder at Madingley Grange</h2><p>Simon and Laurie Hannaford have transformed Madingley Grange into a stage where guests solve pretend murders, but when real murder occurs, the guests start looking like sitting ducks and the fear becomes palpable</p><p>Dubbed by the Sunday Times as, &#39;Simply the best detective writer since Agatha Christie&#39; and by the Yorkshire Post as &#39;the most underrated British crime writer&#39;, Caroline Graham is the author of eight Inspector Barnaby novels.A game of murder in an English country house appears headed for the real thing in this lumbering attempt at a romp. Simon Hannaford and his sister Laurie are left in charge of their aunt's estate near Oxford while she travels abroad; to settle some debts, Simon decides to sponsor a murder-mystery weekend for well-paying guests. Those who sign on include mystery aficionado Derek Gregory; his wife, Sheila; and snooty Mrs. Laetitia Saville with her daughter Rosemary, who are appalled by the wealthy but common gypsy family Gibbs--Fred, Vi and Mother Gibbs. It soon appears that everyone at Madingley Grange has arrived with ulterior motives, including the temp-service staff who are casing the place with an eye to burglary. When Derek is chosen victim, much to his voluble distaste, and then is found actually murdered the next day, Simon and Laurie's problems really begin. While Graham ( Death of a Hollow Man ) does give us the outline of a classic country house mystery, this is not Wodehouse-meets-Christie material, lacking the essential wit and complexity of both masters.

Published originally in 1907, the stories collected here were set in prose by the Welsh folklorist W. Jenkyn Thomas, editor of classical texts and of the poetry collection Penillion Telyn (1894), and illustrated by the Hungarian graphic artist Willy Pogany in the art nouveau idiom that was at the height of its popularity in the first decade of the twentieth century. This edition includes an introduction by Juliette Wood, chronicling and contextualising changing attitudes towards the work of folklorists and Welsh folk studies, to present again this important example of illustrated text from Wales.</p></p><p>The Welsh Fairy Book is a classic collection of Welsh stories and legends. Reprinted many times since its first appearance in 1907, this collection has had a significant influence on peoples&#39; conception of the nature and content of Welsh folk tradition. W. Jenkyn Thomas&#39;s refined prose and Willy Pogany&#39;s imaginative illustrations are characteristic of a romantic view of fairytales. However, the study of folklore has moved away from the romantic to become more rigorously, academic. Juliette Wood&#39;s introduction places the author and the book in context and charts the changes in attitudes to collecting and editing folktales and the development of Welsh folk studies.<p><b>William Jenkyn Thomas</b> was the first Head Master of the Aberdare Intermediate School.

"Free will was no academic question to Luther; the whole Gospel of the grace of God, he held, was bound up with it, and stood or fell according to the way one decided it . . . . It is not the part of a true theologian, Luther holds, to be unconcerned, or to pretend to be unconcerned, when the Gospel is in danger . . . . The doctrine of the Bondage of the Will in particular was the corner-stone of the Gospel and the foundation of faith'' (40-41, emphasis added). ''In particular, the denial of free will was to Luther the foundation of the Biblical doctrine of grace, and a hearty endorsement of that denial was the first step for anyone who would understand the Gospel and come to faith in God. The man who has not yet practically and experimentally learned the bondage of his will in sin has not yet comprehended any part of the Gospel" "Justification by faith only is a truth that needs interpretation. The principle of sola fide [by faith alone] is not rightly understood till it is seen as anchored in the broader principle of sola gratia [by grace alone]; . . . for to rely on one&#x2019;s self for faith is not different in principle from relying on one&#x2019;s self for works" The Bible teaches that faith itself is and has to be, a gift of God, by grace, and not of self (Ephesians 2:8). It is safe to deduce that for Luther, any evangelist who advocates free will has not only ''not yet comprehended any part of the Gospel,'' but also that he has not yet preached the Gospel at all; his is a counterfeit gospel.Luther was ordered to recant his teachings on threat of excommunication. Luther thundered, ''Unless I am convinced by Scriptures and plain reason [for Luther, this meant logic], my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and I will not recant anything. Here I stand, I can do no other!" [From a review in The Trinity Review] Martin Luther (1483-1546) shattered the structure of the Medieval Church by demanding that the authority for doctrine and practice be the Scriptures rather than popes or councils, and ignited the famous Protestant Reformation. The Roman Catholic hierarchy could not refute his logic, so they attempted to have him killed. But he was protected by Frederic. It has been said that more books have been written about Luther than about any other person except Jesus Christ. 164 pages, hard cover</p><p>First published in 1525, Martin Luther&#39;s Bondage of the Will is acknowledged by theologians as one of the great masterpieces of the Reformation. It is Luther&#39;s response to Desiderius Erasmus&#39; Diatribe on Free Will, written in his direct and unique style, combining deep spirituality with humor.Martin Luther (1483-1546) initiated the Protestant Reformation. As a priest and theology professor, he confronted indulgence salesman Johann Tetzel with his The Ninety-Five Theses in 1517. Luther strongly disputed their claim that freedom from God&#39;s punishment of sin could be purchased with money. His refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Edict of Worms meeting in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the emperor. Martin Luther taught that salvation is not from good works, but a free gift of God, received only by grace through faith in Jesus as redeemer from sin. His theology challenged the authority of the pope of the Roman Catholic Church by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge and opposed sacerdotalism by considering all baptised Christians to be a holy priesthood. Those who identify with Luther&#39;s teachings are called Lutherans. His translation of the Bible into the language of the people (instead of Latin) made it more accessible, causing a tremendous impact on the church and on German culture. It fostered the development of a standard version of the German language, added several principles to the art of translation, and influenced the translation into English of the King James Bible. His hymns inspired the development of singing in churches. His marriage to Katharina von Bora set a model for the practice of clerical marriage, allowing Protestant priests to marry.</p><h2>Gather Together In My Name</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p>In <i>Gather Together In My Name</i> Maya Angelou continues her stunning autobiography.

GOLDSMITH (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called The Infinite Way. After the publication of his seminal book, The Infinite Way, in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer. Although Goldsmith&#39;s message was neither organized nor advertised, students of The Infinite Way increased in numbers. Today, a worldwide student body exists which continues to practice and preserve his work. More than thirty books have been compiled from his tape-recorded lectures and classwork including &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; &#34;Practicing the Presence&#34; and &#34;The Art of Meditation.&#34;</p><h2>Emergence: A transsexual autobiography</h2><p>&#39;The first complete female-to-male story.

Over 100,000 copies have been printed in the English language, and there are editions in French, German, Dutch, Italian, Swedish, and Spanish.<br>This much-expanded edition is the first thorough revision in 16 years. Twenty new chapters from expert contributors on both sides of the Atlantic cover modern hull shapes and rigs, the latest gear and strategies for outlasting storms at sea, and advances in weather knowledge.

Translated from the French by Joshua Corey and Jean-Luc Garneau. "There is no escape from trees by means of trees." The ordinary objects to which Francis Ponge directs his attention&#x2014;a tree, an oyster, a cigarette&#x2014;come uncannily alive in his seminal first book of prose poems, newly translated by Joshua Corey and Jean-Luc Garneau. Published in 1942, as Ponge was enlisting in the Resistance to the Nazi occupation of France, these poems offer their own dryly humorous resistance to our tendency to take "things" for granted as either dead matter or as commodities for our disposal. Arch, alive, and unexpectedly profound, here is a new Ponge for the age of hyperobjects and the revenge of nature, a poet of the Anthropocene avant la lettre.</p><p>Francis Ponge (1899-1988) famously countered Surrealism's fixation on "the marvelous" with a denuded objectivity, and went on to become one of the most influential French poets of the 20th Century. His 1942 book <em>Le parti pris des choses</em> is considered a literary classic.</p><h2>The Celtic Oracle: Exploring the Inner Worlds (Boxed set - book and Tarot cards)</h2><p>Pack contais 284 pages book and 40 1llustrated cards</p><p></p><h2>Big Book of Beautiful Biscuits</h2><p>This collection features an array of biscuit recipes suitable for every occasion as well as mouthwatering confections to serve with coffee.</p><p></p><h2>Amphibians &amp; Reptiles of the North Woods</h2><p>Part of the popular North Woods Naturalist Series, this field guide contains detailed information with an innovative format that makes field identification a snap!

The play's title comes from a line in Langston Hughes's poem "Harlem," which warns that a dream deferred might "dry up/like a raisin in the sun." <br>"The events of every passing year add resonance to "A Raisin in the Sun," said "The New York Times. "It is as if history is conspiring to make the play a classic."

With a few exceptions--Jimmy Carter and Herbert Hoover come to mind--the period after presidents vacate the White House tends to be abbreviated, idle, and a little sad. Patricia O'Toole's absorbing account of Theodore Roosevelt's final decade carries some of this pathos, but she also vividly captures the spark and sometimes reckless vigor of the most vibrant of presidents. Possessed of an irrepressible self-confidence and insatiable appetite for power, Roosevelt made an unconvincing show of stepping out of the spotlight when he declined to seek reelection in 1909, bequeathing the presidency to loyal foot soldier William Howard Taft. Over the course of Taft's one rather lackluster term, Roosevelt embarked on an extended African safari (where the trailblazing conservationist slaughtered hundreds of animals), but upon his return he became embroiled in a battle with Taft for the heart of the Republican Party. When he lost that struggle, he turned to the budding Progressive Party. Under their banner, Roosevelt bested Taft in the 1912 election, but Woodrow Wilson, of course, beat them both. Roosevelt's bursting-at-the-seams life has been thoroughly chronicled, but O'Toole wisely focuses on a period when the never-retiring giant of American politics was wounded (both figuratively and literally--he was shot while campaigning and insisted on giving a speech before going to a hospital), but wouldn't, or couldn't, give up the fight. <i>--Steven Stolder</i><b>Patricia O'Toole</b> is also the author of <i>Money and Morals in America: A History</i> and <i>The Five of Hearts: An Intimate Portrait of Henry Adams and His Friends,</i> which was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.

The <i>National Geographic Expeditions Atlas</i> looks at more than 100 years of National Geographic Society-funded or -chronicled explorations to the poles, undersea, skyward, and into our past. Though it contains plenty of maps from many eras covering small and large scales, the book is more a beautifully illustrated travelogue of adventure than an atlas proper; few will complain, however. The photography is transcendent, skimming the very best of National Geographic's deservedly respected work to reveal the depths of ice caves, the heights of Everest, never-before-recorded ruins, and hundreds of exhausted explorers. Even the most thoroughgoing stay-at-homes will find themselves pining for the fjords as they read the exploits of the daredevils and scientists who roam the frontiers or create new ones. The writing is subdued, but it pays careful attention to details, humanizing the men and women involved and bringing their day-to-day struggles to vibrant life. Jacques Cousteau, Theodore Roosevelt, Louis and Mary Leakey, Amelia Earhart, Jane Goodall, and John Glenn are some of the famous names on the roster of National Geographic explorers--and the introductory timeline highlights an encouraging trend toward more and more adventurers and expeditions as the years advance. The more you read, the more tempted you'll be to join them yourself. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>The yellow-bordered monthly frequently reprises its best-known articles for its loyal subscribers to savor, and this glossy slab of tabletop recycling features explorations that the National Geographic Society directly sponsored, from 1910, when the society made its name underwriting expeditions to Alaska, to the late 1990s. Although it contains some maps, it is not exactly an "atlas"; rather, the dramatic photograph dominates from cover to cover. The editors organize their greatest hits by topic: mountaineering (inevitably starring Mount Everest), aviation, polar exploration and adventures, assorted archaeological sites discovered in the twentieth century (especially pre-Columbian ones, such as Machu Picchu), underwater archaeology, and paleoanthropology (which National Geo popularized and also the Leakey name with its articles). Indeed, fame came to many thanks to its auspices: here, one gets reacquainted with the smiling, weather-beaten visage of Jacques-Yves Cousteau and with the solitary Jane Goodall and her chimpanzees. This tome will satisfy the library browser's needs with the beauty and grandeur of its photographs. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Spanning film, video games, radical history, architecture, visual effects, and war, the book crosses the twentieth century into our present to confront a new order of seeing and making that slowly took shape: the composite image, where no clean distinction can be made between production and post-production, filmed and animated, material and digital. Giving equal ground to costly blockbusters, shaky riot footage, disaster photography, and early cinema, Williams leads us from the computer-generated &#x201c;shards&#x201d; of particles and debris to the broken phones screen on which we watch these digital storms, looking for the unexpected histories lived in the interval between.</p><p><b>Evan Calder Williams&nbsp;</b>is a writer and artist.

Candid and utterly unexpected, this book is not just for Canadians concerned about the future of the Liberal Party, but for all citizens concerned about the future of Canada and of political discourse in today's increasingly partisan world.&nbsp; <br><br>In 2011, the "Natural Governing Party of Canada" suffered its greatest defeat when Stephen Harper's Conservatives won a majority and Jack Layton's NDP superseded the Liberals to form the Official Opposition. It has spawned a time of soul-searching for the Liberal Party and its former leader, Michael Ignatieff--but while the party continues to look for answers, Ignatieff has found his in <i>Fire and Ashes</i>: the reasons why he went into politics in the first place. In what he says is the most difficult book he's ever written, Ignatieff (the son of a Canadian diplomat whose reputation was made long before he risked it all in politics) explores what it is to be a citizen and why, even in today's adversarial climate, the aspirations of the political life can still outweigh the costs.</p><p>MICHAEL IGNATIEFF was born and educated in Toronto. He gained a doctorate in history at Harvard and has held academic posts there and at Cambridge, Oxford, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of London and the London School of Economics. His critically-acclaimed books include <i>The Russian Album</i> and <i>Scar Tissue</i>. His 6-part documentary series, <i>Blood and Belonging</i>, on nationalism, was shown on BBC2, CBC and PBS, and went on to win major awards in Canada and the United States. Ignatieff's writings have appeared in all the leading journals of Britain and North America, and he was for several years director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. At the end of 2005 he returned to his native Canada and entered the political arena, being elected a Liberal Member of Parliament and subsequently becoming leader of the party before stepping down after the election of 2011. He teaches human rights and politics at the Munk School of Global Affairs at the University of Toronto.&#x201c;Extraordinary.... <i>Fire and Ashes</i> is a brilliant testament to the state of our politics, a cautionary tale about the perils, and pleasures, of political life and a must-read primer for anyone contemplating a political career.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;Robert Collison, <i>Toronto Star</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Compelling and curiously moving account.... For a clear-eyed, sharply observed, mordant but ultimately hopeful account of contemporary politics this memoir is hard to beat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;<i>The Guardian</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;A charming book, frank and funny.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x2014;Paul Wells, <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i> <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Engagingly frank....

Six years after that immersion in political life, he goes back to his library, he does some thinking and he offers us an exceptionally insightful and honest account of that adventure.

Their program results in eating balanced, nutritious, high-fiber foods, making dieting "unnecessary and as obsolete as sealing wax."<p> The Diamonds explain that body functions have a daily cycle: noon to 8 p.m.-- appropriation (eating and digestion); 8 p.m. to 4 a.m.--assimilation (absorption and use); 4 a.m. to noon--elimination (of body wastes and food debris). <i>Fit for Life</i> aims to return you to a lifestyle based on your natural body cycles. That means 70 percent of your diet should be "high-water-content foods"--fruits and vegetables--which facilitate all body functions. Consume nothing but fruit or fruit juice until noon, then eat salad and vegetables with every meal for the rest of the day.</p><p> Two-thirds of the book is explanation and discussion; one-third is menu plans and recipes. You won't be hungry, your food choices will be healthy, and you'll lose weight without dieting. <i>--Joan Price</i></p>Harvey and Marilyn Diamond are also the authors of the bestselling <em>Fit For Life </em>2.

Known since antiquity as the island in the sun, it has a distinctly "eastern" air in its dusty and languid towns, its baroque cities, its bougainvillea-laced coastal ring. Sicily's position as a Mediterranean crossroads has meant that over the years cultures of remarkable brilliance have flourished and endured there. One such culture, the medieval Arabs, ruled Sicily for nearly 250 years, and in their wake left striking influences on the architecture, agriculture, and cuisine.<br>In Cucina Paradiso, Clifford Wright chronicles his fascinating quest for what he affectionately calls the "lost paradise" of Sicilian cuisine, the culinary heritage of the Arabs in Sicily. From his first visit there in 1983, he discovered that the sights, smells, and sounds of Sicily reverberate with an Arab feeling, an aura that is not a mirage but a story waiting to be told. Reflecting his two loves - research and cooking - he set about finding and recording this delicious legacy.<br>Here is a cuisine of exotic ingredients - saffron, capers, golden raisins, pine nuts, orange zest, fresh anchovy - combined in a heavenly way, providing the reader with recipes that are the key to this delicious paradise. Searching for traces of Arab culinary influence while meandering through Sicily, Wright visited small trattorias and private homes and sampled such dishes as Sasizzedi Aggrassati (beef rolls stuffed with pecorino cheese, parsley, golden raisins, and pine nuts, and sauteed in Marsala wine) and Gamberetti al Pomodoro (a savory dish of shrimp, tomatoes, capers, raisins, celery, and pine nuts). He discovered that Sicilians do not agree as to what, exactly, the Arab influence on the cuisine is, but they do agree there are some common characteristics: the absence of antipasti, the piatto unico, or one-pot meal; the confectionery; the blending of nuts or breadcrumbs with raisins or currants and saffron for stuffings; stuffed and skewered foods in general, rice dishes (some food writers argue that the famous risotto Milanese is an Arab-Sicilian invention transplanted north); sweet-and-sour dishes; and the use of citrus fruits in the preparation of meat and fish dishes.<br>Whatever the foundations of Sicilian food may be, one thing is certain: Sicilian food is different from Italian food. All of the more than 175 recipes in this book attest to this completely Sicilian spirit. All pay tribute to the historical and traditional origins of each dish. In writing this very special cookbook, Clifford Wright brings to his subject the meticulousness of a scholar and the passion of a true food aficionado. His enthusiasm for the exotic and unusual combinations of flavors the Arab influence imparts to the heavenly food of Sicily is more than infectious - Cucina Paradiso tantalizes and delights, filling up our minds as well as our stomachs. It is a feast of a book like no other.</p><p>Researched by Middle East scholar and food enthusiast Wright ( After the Palestine-Israel War ), this fascinating volume clarifies the mystifying distinction between the cooking of Sicily and other regions of Italy. The reason for the distinction--as he convincingly presents it--was the medieval conquest of Sicily by Arabs whose "culture remained there intact for four hundred years." According to Wright, the Arabs are responsible for, among other things, the creation of the Sicilian "one-pot" meal, a "fondness for stuffed foods . . . shared by the Sicilians," and the introduction of rice, of which "some food writers even argue that the famous Risotto alla Milanese is an Arab-Sicilian invention transplanted north." The resulting collection of recipes reflects Sicily's exotic heritage and includes a mint-infused, Arab-style penne, grilled beef rolls with pecorino, currants and pine nuts and watermelon pudding studded with semisweet chocolate bits, pistachios and candied orange peel. This suggestive study of "the food Sicilians call cucina arabo-sicula " decorously removes another delicious layer of Italy's riches. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>With No One as Witness (Inspector Lynley)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;[A] juicy serial killer whodunit.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>USA Today</em></p><p>&#x201c;Delicately textured...achingly compassionate....It&#x2019;s one of George&#x2019;s best, and that&#x2019;s saying something.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<em>Seattle Times </em></p><p>The 13th novel in Elizabeth George&#x2019;s acclaimed, <em>New York Times</em> bestselling Inspector Linley crime fiction series, <em>With No One as Witness</em> is arguably the most riveting, shocking, and emotionally compelling of the lot. The hunt for a serial killer who has been murdering and mutilating young boys in London has Scotland Yard Detective Superintendent Thomas Lynley and his team of investigators racing to stop the slaughter, only to have the investigation nearly derailed by one devastating, truly game changing event. An American author, George has been praised as &#x201c;a master of the British mystery&#x201d; by the <em>New York Times</em>, one of only two Yanks whose crime novels have been adapted for the PBS TV series, &#x201c;Mystery,&#x201d;&nbsp; and her exceptional police procedurals rank with the best of Ian Rankin, Peter Robinson, and Ruth Rendell.<br></p></p><p><p>The police never suspect that a serial killer might be at large until they discover the fourth body&#x2014;the first white victim&#x2014;draped across a tomb in a London graveyard. Now, accusations of racism are rampant and Scotland Yard is on the defensive, scrambling to apprehend a maniac while trying to avoid a potential public relations disaster.

His incisive portraits, erotically charged nudes, beautiful drawings, and primitivistic sculpture have been admired for decades. Modigliani&#39;s work, however, has typically been examined in the limited context of his so-called bohemian, anti-intellectual lifestyle. This groundbreaking book revises this approach toward Modigliani&#39;s art, presenting a convincing revisionist examination of the unique historical, social, religious, and cultural significance of his oeuvre. Modigliani: Beyond the Myth looks at the artist and his art from a variety of important perspectives: his proud heritage as a Sephardic Jew, whose spirituality embraced non-Western, classical, and Christian iconography while retaining his own ethnic identity; his critical engagement with the dialogues of the most radical of his avant-garde contemporaries (Picasso, Soutine, Matisse, and Brancusi); the influence of tribal art and Judaism on his portraiture; the representation of the female nude in his works from a feminist cultural perspective; and the remarkable reception of his work in Italy during his lifetime. Lavishly illustrated and including a detailed chronology of his life, this fascinating book situates Modigliani anew in the history of twentieth-century art.</p><p>This book is the catalogue for a major exhibition at The Jewish Museum, New York (May 21 to Semptember 19, 2004); the Art Gallery of Ontario (October 23, 2004 to January 23, 2005); and the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.

She lives in San Diego, California. Visit her website at www.kathleenkrull.com.&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p>"No one expected such a tiny girl to have a first birthday," begins this inspiring biographical sketch of a legendary track stars. Born in 1940 in Tennessee, the chronically sickly though "lively" Rudolph contracted polio just before her fifth birthday. Though not expected to walk again, the fiercely determined girl persevered with her leg exercises; by the time she was 12, she no longer needed her steel brace. Eight years later, Rudolph represented the U.S. in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, where, despite a twisted ankle, she became the first American woman to win three gold medals during a single Olympic competition. Krull's (Lives of the Musicians) characteristic, conversational style serves her especially well here. Through her words the nearly superhuman Rudolph seems both personable and recognizable. Rendered in acrylic, watercolor and gouache, Caldecott Medalist Diaz's (Smoky Night) imposing, richly hued illustrations have a distinctive, cubist feel. The artist's bold design superimposes this art against sepia-toned photographs of relevant background images: playground sand, wooden fence slats, the gravel of a running track. This juxtaposition yields busy, effectively textured pages, flawed only by the text's curiously embellished font-the letters look as though they have been speckled with either ink blots or dust.

Sometimes you&#x2019;d find kids finishing homework due the next period. You could tell that&#x2019;s what they were doing&#x2014;they had a wide-eyed, racing-the-clock air to them, and they gripped their pens so hard that blood stopped flowing to their fingertips. But this was the last week of school, and there was no more homework. Kids sat in little clusters, talking semi-quietly, occasionally bursting into laughter, which would attract a glare from Mrs. Livetta, the study hall monitor. A couple of kids were reading, and one girl, with hypnotic concentration, was covering her desktop with elaborate graffiti.</p><p>Winston, of course, was solving a puzzle. He kept a couple of puzzle books in his schoolbag at all times. There had been a day earlier in the year when he found himself puzzleless in study hall, and Mrs. Livetta refused to let him go to his locker. With nothing to read and nothing to solve, he sat there for a while in utter boredom. In fact, that was the day he discovered that the letters of BOREDOM can be scrambled to make the word BEDROOM. That was a pleasing discovery, at least.</p><p>Now he was always prepared. He clicked a few times on his mechanical pencil and doodled in the margin while he thought.</p><p></p><p><i>In a word square, words read the same both across and down. In the following two puzzles, solve the clues to create the word square.</i></p><p><i>This last word square has five letters in each word . . . and the clues aren&#x2019;t given in order, so you&#x2019;ll have to figure out which word goes where.</i></p><p></p><p><i>(Answers, page 239.)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Winston!&#x201d; Mrs. Livetta all but screamed in his ear.</p><p>Winston jerked like a freshly caught fish, nearly falling out of his chair. The other kids in the study hall laughed. Mrs. Livetta was standing in front of him, hands on hips.</p><p>&#x201c;Wh-what? Yes?&#x201d; Winston tried to regain his wits. He knew what had happened. Sometimes he became so absorbed in a puzzle that the world around him simply faded away. Mrs. Livetta must have called him once or twice from the comfort of her chair and then, when Winston didn&#x2019;t answer, said his name louder, and then louder still, and then she finally came over and yelled at him. The next step might have been to hit him with a textbook.</p><p>The kids laughed again, but Mrs. Livetta wasn&#x2019;t laughing. &#x201c;You are wanted down at the principal&#x2019;s office. Didn&#x2019;t you hear the announcement?&#x201d; She pointed at the loudspeaker on the wall.</p><p>Winston reddened. It was worse than he thought. The loudspeaker, which was indeed loud, had barked his name, and he hadn&#x2019;t heard it at all. Wow. That had to be some kind of record.</p><p>Wait a minute&#x2014;the principal&#x2019;s office wanted to see him?</p><p>&#x201c;Why does the principal want to see me?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Mrs. Livetta said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a loudspeaker&#x2014;you can&#x2019;t have a conversation with it. Ask when you get down there. Now go!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>Was he in trouble? He couldn&#x2019;t see how. Was something wrong at home? His mind reached in every direction at once as he walked through the empty hallways down to the main office. As he rounded the corner to the school&#x2019;s large central lobby, the intercom system crackled and chirped. The school secretary said once again, in the voice of an old lady robot: &#x201c;Winston Breen, please report to the principal&#x2019;s office. Winston Breen, to the principal&#x2019;s office.&#x201d; Boy, whatever the reason was, they sure wanted to see him. He bit his lower lip and tried to prepare himself.</p><p>When he reached the main office, Mrs. Lembo was still returning to her desk from the PA system. &#x201c;Ah, there you are,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sorry,&#x201d; said Winston.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, go right in. Mr. Unger&#x2019;s expecting you.&#x201d;</p><p>The principal&#x2019;s office was down a short hallway, ending in a door you never wanted to open. Winston had never had a reason to knock on this door, and that was fine with him. He was still trying to figure out some way he might be in trouble. He took a deep breath and knocked softly. &#x201c;Come in,&#x201d; said a brusque voice. Winston creaked the door open.</p><p>Mr. Unger was not behind his desk. He was up and pacing. &#x201c;Ah, Winston. Good. Thought maybe you were absent today. Or cutting class!&#x201d;</p><p>Winston recognized that as a joke but had no idea how to respond. &#x201c;Yes, no, um, I was&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>But Mr. Unger wasn&#x2019;t looking for any explanations. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re still the puzzle person, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure. . . .&#x201d; Winston had shuffled entirely into the room now. He watched the principal pace back and forth, glancing occasionally at a piece of paper in his hand. When Mr. Unger walked the halls in his gray suit and shiny shoes, he was a severe, frowning authority. Now he didn&#x2019;t look stern at all. In fact, he looked rather like&#x2014;Winston could hardly believe it&#x2014;an excited little kid.</p><p>&#x201c;All right. All right. Good,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I want you to look at this. Here.&#x201d; Mr. Unger thrust the paper into Winston&#x2019;s hands.</p><p>It was quite fancy&#x2014;stiff and crackly, and the color of rich cream. On it were a bunch of letters and numbers, written in ink: </p><p><i>(Continue reading to see the answer to this puzzle.)</i></p><p></p><p>This was not at all what he had expected from a visit to the principal&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;What is this?&#x201d; asked Winston.</p><p>&#x201c;I was hoping you could tell me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It looks like a code of some kind. Where did it come from?&#x201d;</p><p>Unger shook his head. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t know. It was in my mailbox this morning, but there was no return address.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was there a postmark?&#x201d;</p><p>Mr. Unger stopped pacing. &#x201c;The postmark! I didn&#x2019;t think of that. I knew you were the right person to call on this.&#x201d; He sat down in his chair, leaned over, and dug through his garbage pail, looking for the right envelope. &#x201c;Aha, here we go,&#x201d; he said. The envelope was fancy, too. Mr. Unger brushed it off and looked at it, frowning.</p></p><h2>Asterix and the Actress</h2><p>Set in 50 B.C., these hysterical historical tales follow the adventures of Asterix and his pals in the days of the Roman Empire. Normally, he&#x2019;s concerned about protecting his town from the legionnaires (with the help of a magic potion), but here something else is on his mind: his surprise birthday party! Meanwhile, two old friends are about to turn up again...and they&#x2019;re up to something interesting. &#x201c;Great for leading high-school students into discussion of history and literary devices.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Booklist </i><br></p><p>Rene Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926, and spent most of his childhood in Argentina, before eventually moving to Paris in 1951. He died in 1977. Albert Uderzo was born in 1927 in a small village in Marne, France. He met Rene Goscinny in 1951 and on 29 October 1959 their most famous creation, Asterix, made his first appearance on page 20 of Pilote. ASTERIX THE GAUL, their first album, was published in 1961 and there have now been 35 Asterix albums.Gr. 4-7. Asterix, the hero of more than 30 comic stories set in 50 B.C. Gaul, is back here in his first new graphic novel adventure in five years. Uderzo's customary wit, humane insights, and silly physical antics allow readers new to the series to join the fun as Asterix and the oversized Obelix celebrate their mutual birthday, get tricked by Pompey's pretend Panacea, and rescue their fathers from a Roman prison. Translated from the French with a liberal combination of Latin puns and contemporary social riffs--including a reference to hitching a ride in an HGV (Heavy Gaulish Vehicle)--the story has cross-generational appeal. The illustrations are, as expected, ridiculous cartoons; this includes the one-panel representation of an African sailor, as well as the images of the heroes, their families, and the enemy Romans. In addition to being fun for middle-readers, this will be great for leading high-school students into discussion of history and literary devices. <i>Francisca Goldsmith</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From #1 New York Times bestselling author Leigh Bardugo comes a mesmerizing tale of power, privilege, and dark magic set among the Ivy League elite. Galaxy &#34;Alex&#34; Stern is the most unlikely member of Yale&#39;s freshman class. Raised in the Los Angeles hinterlands by a hippie mom, Alex dropped out of school early and into a world of shady drug-dealer boyfriends, dead-end jobs, and much, much worse. In fact, by age twenty, she is the sole survivor of a horrific, unsolved multiple homicide. Some might say she&#39;s thrown her life away. But at her hospital bed, Alex is offered a second chance: to attend one of the world&#39;s most prestigious universities on a full ride. What&#39;s the catch, and why her? Still searching for answers, Alex arrives in New Haven tasked by her mysterious benefactors with monitoring the activities of Yale&#39;s secret societies. Their eight windowless &#34;tombs&#34; are the well-known haunts of the rich and powerful, from high-ranking politicos to Wall Street&#39;s biggest players. But their occult activities are more sinister and more extraordinary than any paranoid imagination might conceive. They tamper with forbidden magic. They raise the dead. And, sometimes, they prey on the living. Ninth House is the long-awaited adult debut by the beloved author of Shadow and Bone and Six of Crows. Leigh Bardugo will take her place alongside Lev Grossman and Deborah Harkness as one of the finest practitioners of literary fantasy writing today.</p><p></p><h2>Maya History</h2><p>The ruins of Maya city-states occur throughout the Yucatan peninsula, Guatemala, Belize, and in parts of Honduras and El Salvador. But the people who built these sites remain imperfectly known. Though they covered standing monuments (stelae) and public buildings with hieroglyphic records of their deeds, no Rosetta Stone has yet turned up in Central America to help experts determine the exact meaning of these glyphs.<br>Tatiana Proskouriakoff, a preeminent student of the Maya, made many breakthroughs in deciphering Maya writing, particularly in demonstrating that the glyphs record the deeds of actual human beings. This discovery opened the way for a history of the Maya, a monumental task that Proskouriakoff was engaged in before her death in 1985. Her work, Maya History, has been made ready for press by the able editorship of Rosemary Joyce.<br>Maya History reconstructs the Classic Maya period (roughly A.D. 250-900) from the glyphic record on stelae at numerous sites, including Altar de Sacrificios, Copan, Dos Pilas, Naranjo, Piedras Negras, Quirigua, Tikal, and Yaxchilan. Proskouriakoff traces the spread of governmental institutions from the central Peten, especially from Tikal, to other city-states by conquest and intermarriage. And she also shows how the gradual introduction of foreign elements into Maya art mirrors the entry of outsiders who helped provoke the eventual collapse of the Classic Maya. Fourteen line drawings of monuments and over three hundred original drawings of glyphs amplify the text.<br>Maya History has been long awaited by scholars in the field. It is sure to provoke lively debate and greater understanding of this important area in Mesoamerican studies.</p><p>&#34;Maya History is the final life work of the person who was to our field as Darwin was to biology.&#34; (Linda Schele, coauthor of A Forest Of Kings and The Blood Of Kings)</p><h2>Ordeal</h2><p>As four friends embark on a wilderness adventure in Montana&#39;s Bitterroot Mountains, a stranger is watching their progress and plotting a diabolical scheme that will hurl them into a deadly game where the ultimate prize is survival.

His writings influenced notable New Thought authors and leaders.</p><h2>Consumer Rites: The Buying &amp; Selling of American Holidays</h2><p><p>Slogans such as "Let's put Christ back into Christmas" or "Jesus is the Reason for the Season" hold an appeal to Christians who oppose the commercializing of events they hold sacred. However, through a close look at the rise of holidays in the United States, Leigh Schmidt show us that commercial appropriations of these occasions were as religious in form as they were secular. The rituals of America's holiday bazaar that emerged in the nineteenth century offered a luxuriant merger of the holy and the profane--a heady blend of fashion and faith, merchandising and gift-giving, profits and sentiments, all celebrations of a devout consumption. In this richly illustrated book, which captures both the blessings and ballyhoo of American holiday observances for the mid-eighteenth century through the twentieth, the author offers a reassessment of the "consumer rites" that various social critics have long decried for their spiritual emptiness and banal sentimentality.</p><br><p> Schmidt tells the story of how holiday celebrations were almost banished by Puritans and other religious reformers in the colonies but went on to be romanticized and reinvented in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Merchants and advertisers were crucial for the reimagining of the holidays, promoting them in a grand, carnivalesque manner, which could include gargantuan fruit cakes, masked Santa Clauses, and exploding valentines.</p><br><p> Along the way Schmidt uses everything from diaries to manuals on church decoration and window display to show in bright detail the ways in which people have prepared for and celebrated specific holidays--such as going Christmas shopping, making love tokens, choosing Easter bonnets, sending flowers to Mom, buying ties for Dad. He demonstrates in particular how women took the lead as holiday consumers, shaping warm-hearted celebrations of home and family through their intricate engagement with the marketplace. Bringing together the history of business, religion, and gender, this book offers a fascinating cultural history of an endlessly debated marvel--the commercialization of the American holidays.</p></p><p><p>"The real merit of this book lies in its complex sympathies: it is at once a major contribution to American religious history and to cultural history."<b>--David D.

Author Ronin Ro shows courage in detailing the frightening means used by Knight to corner the market on the most hard-core of urban music. It&#39;s a tale that reads like it was written by the bastard offspring of Horatio Alger and Quentin Tarantino. Knight&#39;s forceful style and legal entanglements have been the stuff of legend for years. Most music reporters, coming face to face with the thugs who enforced the rules at Death Row, have been afraid to tell the story. With Knight safely behind bars and Death Row in disrepair, Ronin Ro finally has the chance to put this violent soap opera in print."Harrowing and definitive, <i>Have Gun Will Travel</i> succeeds so spectacularly because Ronin Ro is blessed with a rare combination of street smarts, solid writing skills...and cojones of steel."<br>--Michael Azerrad, author of <i>Come as Your Are: The Story of Nirvana</i><p>"The first informed look at a world the mainstream media still seems unable to penetrate."<br><i>--New York Post</i></p><p></p></p><h2>In the Memory of the Forest</h2><p>When the body of Tomek, a young distillery worker, is found brutally murdered in the forest outside Jadowia in Poland, his boyhood friend, Leszek, decides to uncover the mystery behind Tomek's death. Assuming the role of amateur sleuth, Leszek embarks on a clue-finding mission that takes him from country to city, into the grimy offices of once-powerful bureaucrats, and face-to-face with the Catholic Church's pious and impotent priests. And as Leszek moves closer to the truth, he is confronted with another strange mystery: the disappearance of stones from the foundations of the town's oldest houses. The further Leszek is drawn into this mystery, the deeper into the past he must search for answers about his people, the grim tragedy of the Holocaust, and ultimately, his own identity.<b>In the Memory of the Forest</b> is a haunting, evocative novel that explores the impact of a murder on a community, and of history and the fate of the Jews in Poland during World War II on a people.</p><p>Even in the days after the collapse of Communism, the Poland of Charles Powers&#39;s novel is an &#34;old country in an old Europe,&#34; a place that harbors the stories and secrets of a complex and tortured history. When a young farmer named Leszek starts looking into the unexplained murder of a childhood friend in his small hometown of Jadowia, he is led into a dark terrain, and begins to uncover difficult truths about war crimes committed by members of his own family.

McKinley Montague, the handsome, enigmatic author of sensational serial-killer novels, was to make a rare book-signing appearance at the grand opening of London's newest superbookstore. <br><br>But the author never arrives -- and word quickly spreads that Montague is dead, the victim of a mysterious boating accident. <br><br>Publisher Alex Plumtree is shocked by McKinley's sudden passing. Yet even more disturbing is the encounter Alex has in a local coffee shop with a reporter that very night. First the scribe reveals he received a tip that McKinley's own publishers had him murdered to boost his sales. Seconds later, a bullet shatters the cafe's window, missing the pair by inches. <br><br>The shooting is only the first of many bizarre incidents, unexplained deaths, and troubling phone calls. And with his own life hanging in the balance, Alex wonders if McKinley's demise was just the opening chapter in London's deadliest literary season ever....<br></p><p><b>Julie Kaewert</b> first indulged her fascination with book publishing by taking the Radcliffe Publishing Procedures Course in 1981. She then worked for book publishers in Boston and London before starting her writing career with a London magazine. Her series of mysteries for booklovers has topped mystery bestseller lists around the country. She is the author of <i>Unprintable</i>,<i> Uncatalogued</i>,<i> Unsigned</i>,<i> Unbound</i>,<i> Unsolicited</i>, and <i>Untitled.</i><b>Chapter 1 <br></b><br><i>Now there lived overseas <br>In the land of the Geats a youth of valiance abounding, <br>Mightiest yet mildest of men, his name Beowulf, <br>Who, hearing of Grendel [was] minded to destroy him...<br></i>&#x2014; <b>Beowulf</b> <br><br>The moment before the bullet struck, I was glaring at a journalist I didn't like over a cup of coffee I didn't want. At eleven o'clock on this Saturday night,I was meant to be sipping champagne next door at the literary event of the year; instead, I had just burnt my tongue. The lights of the Meridien Hotel opposite twinkled gaily, illuminating this stretch of Piccadilly as its flags flapped to and fro in the October gale. It was the opening night of National Book Week, and it wasn't supposed to happen this way.<br><br>"Let me get this straight, Nathan," I said, replacing my cup on its saucer with studied composure. "You expect me to believe that Trevor Gravesend -- owner of Britain's most eminent publishing company and president of the Publishers Association &#x2014; had his star author murdered to increase sales?"<br><br>Before answering, Nathan Griffith sucked hard on a cigarette, his fingers shaking, and cast suspicious glances at the few others populating the coffee bar. Nate, a staff writer for Britain's publishing and bookselling organ, the <i>Bookseller</i>, looked more gaunt than usual. The twenty-something journalist was cursed with an old man's body: his prematurely wrinkled face, ashen from frightening excesses of nicotine and alcohol, was sadly consistent with his balding pate and cadaverous frame. With the hand holding the cigarette he raked a few tenacious hairs across the top of his head and blew smoke to one side.<br><br>"I don't like it any more than you do, Plumtree. But that anonymous caller was very serious indeed. It could have happened as he said. Think about it: Gravesend was quite concerned about Montague's book, between the obscene advance he had to pay, and its wandering nature. You saw the reviews. And the title! I mean, really &#x2014; <b>Beowulf's Blood</b>? What could Gravesend have been thinking of?" Out of habit, Nate fingered the terrifically tattered and grimy notebook he dragged with him everywhere for recording industry secrets.<br><br>I stifled my irritation, vowing to give Nate a badly needed lesson in literature &#x2014; and no more than three minutes of my time. It was beyond me why Nate had chosen me as his father confessor. "Actually, Beowulf strikes me as a rather nice association for a novel about a monstrous serial killer &#x2014; noble Beowulf versus the hideous Grendel, the timeless battle of good versus evil. You're an avid Trekkie &#x2014; don't you discuss this very sort of thing at your Star Trek sci-fi conferences? Use your common sense, Nate. McKinley Montague's signing takes place in less than an hour. Why haven't we heard anything about the author's tragic death? Besides, to make such an accusation about Trevor Gravesend &#x2014; of all people &#x2014; on the basis of an anonymous caller ... really, Nathan, you should be more careful. Perhaps your libel law needs swotting up."<br><br>"Plumtree, listen to me." Nathan looked ready to jump out of his skin in his desperation to convince me. "Please! Try for once to expect the worst in someone. Someone who stands to lose a hell of a lot if he doesn't have a best-seller in his pocket on his way to the Frankfurt Book Fair and Merger Mania. Someone who cares about money more than&#x2014;"<br><br>Crack! Instinctively, I raised my arm to shield my face from the cascade of glass that rained down next to me. The deafening collapse of the window seemed to carry on and on, as if all the glass in Piccadilly had just shattered at my elbow. Sheets and shards exploded into a million pieces, flying in all directions and tinkling endlessly onto the marble floor of the small establishment.<br><br>In the next moment, all was eerily quiet. I looked across at Nathan, who appeared stunned but unhurt.<br><br>A bullet. Through the window. I knew the sound all too well.<br><br>Reaching across the table, I shoved Nathan down by his shoulder. We scrambled down on our hands and knees, unsuccessfully avoiding the sharp shards of glass as we sought protection beneath the absurdly small table. Nate reached up and groped for his precious notebook; he found it and clutched it to his chest.<br><br>I caught Nate's eye. If the bullet had been intended to silence him, then perhaps it was true: England's most respected publishing house had literally killed to sell books. Good Lord.<br><br>But how had they got on to Nate? Someone must have followed us. ... Quickly, I thought back over the rather extraordinary few minutes that had preceded Nate's appearance that evening.<br><br>The excitement had begun as Nicola Beauchamp, my trade editor, and I were making our way through the windy night to a bookshop grand opening and signing party. Bang in the middle of Piccadilly Circus, a vicious October gale whipped Nicola's skirt up round her waist and held it there. She'd whooped in surprise and fought to clamp it down again, but not before I'd caught a glimpse of her rather stunning legs (and equally noteworthy knickers). Though I failed to stifle a smile, I did avert my eyes &#x2014; only to see an approaching cluster of yobbos gesturing lewdly at poor Nicola and calling out surprisingly creative compliments. I'd reached down to put an arm round my diminutive employee's shoulders, drawing her close as the louts passed.<br><br>When the danger was gone, I dropped my arm again and tried to alleviate her embarrassment. "I'm curious to see what Wellbrook's Books has made of the old Simpson's building. Bit of a challenge to imagine New Fiction in men's haberdashery."<br><br>"I'll say. But all that white marble and glass should set off the books nicely. What I find hard to imagine is the idea of a midnight signing. What sort of a turnout can they possibly expect?" My dignified, petite, very literary editor and I were on our way to a coveted champagne reception celebrating the official opening of the grandest new bookshop in Britain &#x2014; a superstore on the American model, complete with gourmet coffee bar. Everyone was desperately curious to see the transformation of the elegant institution formerly known as Simpson's, where Britain's upper classes had purchased their clothes for generations, into the Wellbrook chain's flagship store.<br><br>But the real highlight of the evening was to be a signing by McKinley Montague, the most sensational novelist in Britain and author of a new serial-killer chiller. Wellbrook's had thoughtfully timed both its opening and Montague's signing to coincide with the launch of National Book Week, now moved to autumn from spring. Personally, I thought it should be moved right back again, because it was too close to the Frankfurt Book Fair, beginning at the very end of this same week. Bit of a cock-up in the NBW planning department.<br><br>At the same moment I'd heard Nate's high-pitched voice calling from behind us &#x2014; Plumtree! Wait! &#x2014; Nicola and I found ourselves caught in the vortex of a small tornado of dried leaves and dust. We stopped in our tracks, Nicola clamping her arms round her thighs prudently as I shut my eyes against a hail of grit. In retrospect, as a publisher of books, I see that dirty little whirlwind as a bit of foreshadowing by the Omniscient Narrator in the Sky &#x2014; the rather obvious sort used by the gooseflesh-generating McKinley Montague. A dirty little whirlwind was about to sweep away British publishing as we knew it . . . but who'd have suspected that such malignant and unsuspected forces would be at work in our gentle world of books?<br><br>Quite right &#x2014; I should have suspected.<br><br>When the whirlwind subsided I blinked half of London out of my contact lenses and glimpsed Nathan Griffith jogging toward us, famous notebook in hand ... Nathan, who never jogged anywhere, and who had written a rather flattering profile of Plumtree Press for the most recent issue of the <i>Bookseller</i>. He caught us up with a disturbing gasp for breath.<br><br>"Nathan! You know Nicola Beauchamp, don't you?" They nodded at one another in greeting and we continued to battle our way down Piccadilly. Between the short, intense young journalist panting on my right and tiny Nicola, I felt a veritable giant. At six foot four, I tower over most people and often worry that it is intimidating.<br><br>"Big night for bookselling news," I shouted cheerfully to Nathan. Ahead of us, the rabble queued for entry to the daringly innovative midnight signing while the bigwigs of the book world walked past them through the door, presenting their invitations to the reception.<br><br>"You don't know the half of it," Nate wheezed. "Alex, I need to talk to you. Alone," he added pointedly, with an obvious glance at Nicola. And so, though I wasn't eager to hear Nathan's latest conspiracy theory regarding the acquisition of publishing companies, I'd agreed to a quick chat. Given his recent complimentary profile of the Press, I felt it would be rude not to do as he asked.<br><br>I left Nicola at the Simpson's &#x2014; I mean Wellbrook's &#x2014; glowing glass front, which shone like the sun onto Piccadilly and revealed acres of white marble floor within. It was disconcerting, as I'd suspected, to look through the doors and see a table of books labelled "New Fiction" where there had always, as long as I could remember, been a mannequin sporting a mackintosh and a brolly. A bit wistfully, I followed Nate as he oozed down the street, gliding away from the party with a liquid motion that always made me feel he was trying to slip away from someone.<br><br>Drawing up next to him, I teased, "Okay, Nate &#x2014; what is it now?" Privately, I was amused by his perpetual assumption that something sinister lurked behind every publishing deal, and every bookcase in the corner shop. But he glanced back as if convinced we were being watched, and without answering did a swift double-take before thrusting me through the door of the coffee bar.<br><br>Was that it, I thought now, under the table with Nate? Had someone followed us from Wellbrook's?<br>No fusillade of bullets had followed the single shot over our table; no gun-toting assassins lurked in the street outside. The rotund, mustachioed coffee shop proprietor seemed stunned, gaping out from behind his massive stainless steel Italian coffee machine. His young washer-up, however, sporting rings through every conceivable (and inconceivable, no doubt) bit of flesh, seemed to instantly assess the situation and take charge.<br><br>Voices began to surge around us, and the ultrahip dishwasher shouted at the half-dozen dazed patrons to stay down as he rushed from behind the worktop to the phone. I saw that the bullet had lodged in a framed photograph of Piccadilly at the turn of the century, a site uncannily close to where the coffee bar now stood. With a creeping certainty I felt the attack had not been a random act of violence. That bullet had been intended for Nathan ... or perhaps for me. Heaven knew I'd been involved in enough political and publishing intrigue to last a lifetime. Either way, we had to get out of there fast. Someone knew where we were, and we were very exposed indeed.<br><br>"Come on," I hissed to Nathan. We slipped and slid on the glass, which skated along under us as we struggled to our feet. Everyone seemed too distracted to pay much attention as I pulled him to the rear of the shop. I opened the exit door and glanced both ways down the narrow, pungent alley. "Let's get you out of here," I breathed, and tugged him past polyethylene bags full of rubbish down to the corner and into Jermyn Street, utterly deserted at this hour. I kept moving past the dark shops of antiquated tailors into St James's Square, past the London Library, and down towards Pall Mall. At last I ducked into the shadows of a recessed doorway, the offices of a well-known software company, and Nathan stumbled up to me. His face was grey.<br><br>"So," he said, wheezing horribly. "They're after me" &#x2014; gasp &#x2014; "at last." His feeble attempt at humour was tragic; his chuckle ended in a frightening coughing fit. "Always thought this might happen &#x2014; " Wheeze. "Bound to." Gasp. "My career &#x2014; " Wheeze. "Built on other people's dirt." He glanced up at me and winced. "You've blood &#x2014; on your face &#x2014; Plumtree. Bits &#x2014; of window glass."<br><br>"You, too, I'm afraid." As we stood huddled in the doorway collecting ourselves, Nathan reached inside his pocket and drew out a folded tissue. He began to wipe at his face with one hand, while reaching for his packet of cigarettes with the other. Odd, I reflected, how we resort to routine activities &#x2014; clean the face, light the cigarette &#x2014; to escape the terror of more disconcerting thoughts. I suddenly felt simultaneously sweaty and cold. Concentrate, Alex....<br><br>I latched on to the possibility that the shot was not deliberately targetted at Nathan. It would be much less disturbing &#x2014; and perhaps more reasonable &#x2014; to believe that it had been a random act of violence. Sadly, those were not as uncommon as they used to be. But try as I might, I couldn't persuade myself the shot hadn't been intentional. As I folded Nathan's tissue over to a clean surface and began to wipe the blood off my face, I felt sharp stabs of pain where tiny bits of glass had lodged in my skin. I brushed them off and counted myself lucky indeed.<br><br>Though he still hadn't caught his breath, I watched in amazement as Nathan groped for a lighter. "Alex," he said around the fag, stuffing the rest of the packet away again.<br><br>"Mmm?"<br><br>The cigarette trembled so violently in his hand that I felt a wave of pity for him. "Watch yourself," he said. "They know I was talking to you."<br><br>They. "Nate, who are 'they'? And come to think of it, why did you tell me?"<br><br>He took a greedy drag of his cigarette, then lifted it out of his mouth. A wry, shaky smile began at one corner. "Because you're a bloody superman, Plumtree, aren't you? I mean, look at you, for heaven's sake. You're known for getting to the bottom of this sort of thing."<br><br>"Hardly. But I do think we should ring the police. After that call you received&#x2014;"<br><br>"You wouldn't do that to me, would you? 'Nate Griffith is helping the police with their enquiries, as the only person with information pertaining to the murder of McKinley Montague?' Come on, Alex."<br><br>"Nathan, you received a tip about a murder. And someone might have just tried to kill you!"<br><br>"I know it. But I have my reasons, and I'm not ringing the police."<br><br>I sighed. Strictly speaking, after gunfire one is obliged to call the police ... but I supposed the omni-pierced dishwasher had done that. Meanwhile, time was creeping on ... not only was Nicola waiting for me at the party, but I wanted to find out what would happen at Wellbrook's. Would McKinley Montague appear or not?<br><br>First I'd have to find a safe place to leave Nathan &#x2014; if I could persuade him to stay away.<br><br>"You will agree that it's too dangerous for you to appear at Wellbrook's?"<br><br>He exhaled a cloud of smoke and nodded. "I'd dearly love to go and investigate. But ... you're right. That bullet was close enough."<br><br>"Come with me, then. I've an idea." I hailed a taxi on the Mall, enduring the driver's curious glances at our imperfectly cleaned faces, and climbed out at a rather special place just off Berkeley Square in Curzon Street.<br><br>"Botkin's?!" Nate exclaimed, turning to me with an incredulous frown. "What on earth are we doing at Botkin's?"<br><br>I unlocked the door to the narrow little building, one of London's finest jewels of a bookshop &#x2014; an institution, in fact &#x2014; and let him in. I switched on the lights, and we took in the lovely wooden round table in the hallway, piled with contemporary fiction. Beyond that was a seating area in front of the large and elegantly fronted fireplace, where Botkin's customers used...</p><h2>Medici</h2><p>Having founded the bank that became the most powerful in Europe in the fifteenth century, the Medici gained political power in Florence, raising the city to a peak of cultural achievement and becoming its hereditary dukes. Among their number were no fewer than three popes and a powerful and influential queen of France. Their patronage brought about an explosion of Florentine art and architecture. Michelangelo, Donatello, Fra Angelico and Leonardo are among the artists with whom they were associated. Thus runs the &#39;received view&#39; of the Medici. Mary Hollingsworth argues that the idea that they were wise rulers and enlightened fathers of the Renaissance is a fiction that has acquired the status of historical fact. In truth, the Medici were as devious and immoral as the Borgias - tyrants loathed in the city they illegally made their own and which they beggared in their lust for power.</p><p></p><h2>Hostiles and Friendlies: Selected Short Writings of Mari Sandoz (Landmark Edition)</h2><p>Here in one volume are Mari Sandoz's reminiscences of life in the Sandhills country; a study of the two Sitting Bulls (the Hunkpapa and the Oglala) and other Indian pieces; a novelette, <i>Bone Joe and the Smokin' Woman</i>; and nine short stories, mostly with a rural setting, including <i>The Vine</i>," her first to be published.

The plot, which revolves around one-upmanship between the boys and the girls, is mostly silly: the boys attack the girls' tent pretending to be vampire wolverines, but the girls are on to them and get the upper hand; the island's males face off against the females to see who can complete a task first, and both teams resort to trickery; the boys trick the girls into believing that there's a big reward for their befriending two turtles who are reputed to be former pets of a rich woman, etc. However some of the dialogue is amusing, and the characters are individuals. This fast-moving story should provide some laughs even for reluctant readers. Susan F.

The heights? Well they were the steps up from the Underground to the front door of what is still for me one of the most excIting places In the world. Yes it has its rivals: diving uncharted coral reefs, pushing through pristine cloud forests or looking down a microscope at a drop of water from the ice at the North Pole. Each are voyages of personal discovery which hold that special excitement of erasing <i>terra incognita</i>. However, the voyage through the terracotta portals of The Natural History Museum is in many ways more awesome, for once within you are in the presence of the real giants of the past: not just the dinosaurs and pachyderms that grace the galleries, but the leviathans of natural history who made their voyages of discovery before the days of air travel, air conditioning and anti-malarials. It was their fortitude that laid the foundations not only of this museum but of taxonomy, genetics, evolution, continental drift, the theories that changed the way we think about ourselves, the planet on which we find expression and the role we play within the continuity of life. Their statues and portraits are there for ready reference, set amongst the glass cases or at rest in the stack rooms that hold the objects of their endeavour -- household names like Cook, Bank, Linnaeus, Darwin and many more. Delve deeper and you will find the works of unsung heroes and heroines, without whose skill and devotion much of the vital information would have been lost. They are the artists who took the same risks as the superstars.</p> <p>This fascinating book makes some amends for the capricious nature of historical record by allowing us to discover those missing links of human endeavour, itself part of the process of evolution. It is a time machine that focuses on just 300 years of the tumultuous story of life that is housed in this great building, a keystone period if ever there was one for it saw the turning of curiosity into science and curiosities into specimens, each of which gave new meaning to all our pasts and still forces us to ask questions concerning all our futures.</p> <p>In 1699, just a few decades after it had been conclusively demonstrated that insects developed from eggs, not from mud, Maria Sibylla Merian travelled to Surinam to produce a series of paintings on the metamorphosis of butterflies, including the food plants of larvae and imagoes. So good were her pictures that when Carl Linnaeus was producing his work describing all the animals then known to science, he included species she had recorded. Two Dutch artists, Hermann and de Bevere, shared the same honour, for it was their artistic expertise that allowed Linnaeus to write the flora of what we now call Sri Lanka. Thanks to the artistic talents of William Bartram, the plant and animal treasures of parts of North America were painted and documented, while in the Pacific, several artists played crucial roles on major expeditions: Sydney Parkinson on James Cook's <i>Endeavour</i> voyage with Joseph Banks and his naturalist Solander; George Forster on Cook's <i>Resolution</i> voyage; and Ferdinand Bauer, reputed to be the best of all natural history artists, on the <i>Investigator</i> with Matthew Flinders. The saga of Darwin on the <i>Beagle</i> is perhaps the most famous voyage of all. However without all the painstaking painting, drawing and cataloguing that had gone before, Darwin and his contemporaries Alfred Russel Wallace and Henry Walter Bates could never have set their findings within the context of natural selection.</p> <p>The existence of this book and the treasure house of evidence it draws on is thanks to the vision of the British government of the late 18th century, a national lottery and the collections which Hans Sloane garnered in his lifetime. One of his most significant collections was made on his first voyage, to Jamaica, from whence he gave the world milk chocolate and a detailed account of the island's natural history, illustrated by a local artist, the Reverend Garret Moore. The end of the era -- 300 years when science and art worked in symbiosis -- came with the ultimate <i>terra incognita</i>, the challenge of earth's own inner space and the invention of photography. The scientists who were part of the voyage of the <i>Challenger</i> relied on a team of artists and photographers to make them famous as they plumbed the secrets of the oceans.</p> <p>It is all too easy to dream about having been one of those early pioneers discovering things for the first time and to forget that in all those places, except the depths of the sea, people had been there long before discovering things for themselves. It is also easy to forget that every new voyage made by an individual is into <i>terra incognita</i>. So to be able to travel with the giants of the past is awesome indeed.</p></p><h2>Liberty and Property: A Social History of Western Political Thought from the Renaissance to Enlightenment</h2><p>The formation of the modern state, the rise of capitalism, the Renaissance and Reformation, the scientific revolution and the Age of Enlightenment have all been attributed to the &#x201c;early modern&#x201d; period. Nearly everything about its history remains controversial, but one thing is certain: it left a rich and provocative legacy of political ideas unmatched in Western history. The concepts of liberty, equality, property, human rights and revolution born in those turbulent centuries continue to shape, and to limit, political discourse today. Assessing the work and background of figures such as Machiavelli, Luther, Calvin, Spinoza, the Levellers, Hobbes, Locke and Rousseau, Ellen Wood vividly explores the ideas of the canonical thinkers, not as philosophical abstractions but as passionately engaged responses to the social conflicts of their day.</p><p><b>Ellen Meiksins Wood,</b> for many years Professor of Political Science at York University, Toronto, is the author of many books, including <i>Democracy Against Capitalism </i>and, with Verso, <i>The Pristine Culture of Capitalism, The Origin of Capitalism, Peasant-Citizen and Slave, Citizens to Lords,</i> <i>Empire of Capital </i>and <i>Liberty and Property</i>.&#x201c;... This book is clearly written, incisively argued, and immensely informative.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i><br><br>&#x201c;a notable book, wide-ranging and perceptive ...

A precocious anarchist firebrand, young Victor was sentenced to five years in a French penitentiary in 1912. Expelled to Spain in 1917, he participated in an anarcho-syndicalist uprising before leaving to join the Revolution in Russia. Detained for more than a year in a French concentration camp, Serge arrived in St.<br>Petersburg early in 1919 and joined the Bolsheviks, serving in the press services of the Communist International. An outspoken critic of Stalin, Serge was expelled from the Party and arrested in 1929. Nonetheless, he managed to complete three novels (<i>Men in Prison</i>, <i>Birth of Our Power</i>, and <i>Conquered City</i>) and a history (<i>Year One of the Russian Revolution</i>), published in Paris. Arrested again in Russia and deported to Central Asia in 1933, he was allowed to leave the<br>USSR in 1936 after international protests by militants and prominent writers like Andr� Gide and Romain Rolland. Using his insider&#x2019;s knowledge, Serge published a stream of impassioned, documented expos�s of Stalin&#x2019;s Moscow show trials and of machinations in Spain, which went largely unheeded. Stateless, penniless, hounded by Stalinist agents, Serge lived in precarious exile in Brussels, Paris, Vichy France, and Mexico City, where he died in 1947. His classic <i>Memoirs of a Revolutionary</i> and his great last novels, <i>Unforgiving Years</i> and <i>The Case of Comrade Tulayev</i> (both available as NYRB Classics), were written &#x201c;for the desk drawer&#x201d; and published posthumously.<br><br>Peter Sedgwick (1934&#x2013;1983) translated and wrote the introductions for Victor Serge&#x2019;s <i>Memoirs</i> and <i>Year One of the Russian Revolution</i>. A lifelong activist and a founding member of the New Left in Britain, he wrote seminal essays on Serge. In addition to his journalism and political writings, he is the author of a book, <i>Psycho-Politics</i>.<br><br>Adam Hochschild has written for <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i> <i>Magazine</i>, <i>The New York Review of Books</i>, and <i>The Nation</i>. His books include <i>King Leopold&#x2019;s Ghost</i> and, most recently, <i>To End All Wars</i>. He teaches at the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.<br><br>George Paizis is the author of <i>Marcel Martinet: Poet of the Revolution</i>, <i>Love and the Novel: The Poetics and Politics of Romantic Fiction</i>, and, with Andrew N. Leak,<i> The Holocaust and the Text: Speaking the Unspeakable</i>. He is a longstanding member of the Socialist Workers Party and until recently was Senior Lecturer in the French Department at University College London.<br><br>Richard Greeman has translated and written the introductions for five of Serge&#x2019;s novels (including <i>Unforgiving Years</i> and <i>Conquered City</i>, both available as NYRB Classics). A veteran Socialist and co-founder of the Praxis Center and Victor Serge Library in Moscow, Russia (www.praxiscenter.ru), Greeman is author of <i>Beware Of &#x201c;Vegetarian&#x201d; Sharks: Radical Rants And Internationalist Essays.</i>&#x201c;The <i>Memoirs</i> tells a harrowing story &#x2014; Serge spent most of his adult life in prison and/or exile and saw the Russian Revolution, which for him was the pinnacle of his life in radical activism, lead to one of the most brutal dictatorships in human memory. But it also is a forward-looking book, committed to recording the history of an era in the obvious hope that others will learn from it. It is both realist and idealist, an attitude that is essential to any functional left-wing, or even liberal, movement.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i><br><br>"<i>Memoirs</i> is a document that is essential, above all, as a denouncement of oppression, an eye-witness account, written in heat and at speed, but with the talent of the true writer, of what it was like to be at the heart of the machine &#x2013; and to stand up to it. This is the most complete edition yet published in English (Sedgwick's first, abridged translation appeared nearly 50 years ago).

Col. George Armstrong Custer attacked a Southern Cheyenne village along the Washita River in present-day western Oklahoma. The subsequent U.S. victory signaled the end of the Cheyennes&#x2019; traditional way of life and resulted in the death of Black Kettle, their most prominent peace chief.</p><p>In this remarkably balanced history, Jerome A. Greene describes the causes, conduct, and consequences of the event even as he addresses the multiple controversies surrounding the conflict.

The case, as described by an attorney assessing its publicity potential, involves "a professor killing a hooker who had a black pimp." The professor is William Douglas, researcher at Tufts University medical school in Boston, middle-aged, married, father of three children; the prostitute, 21-year-old Robin Benedict, from a middle-class Hispanic family, who died one March night in 1983 after being bludgeoned with a sledgehammer by Douglas at his suburban home. The body has never been found, although Benedict's killerat trial he copped a manslaughter plea and is serving an 18-20 year sentencemaintains that he discarded it in a dumpster in Providence, R.I. (Douglas is also serving a concurrent five-year sentence for embezzling tens of thousands of dollars from Tufts, spent on Benedict, his steady hooker.) Had the overlong book been trimmed to bring the case into sharper focus, this study of moral corruption, of police investigation at its most persistent, could have been a classic of its type. Notable nonetheless, it will reward the most dogged readers. Photos not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.One of the decade's most intriguing murders involved a victim and a killer who were not what they seemed: Ruth Benedict was the dutiful, loving daughter of a middle-class family and a Boston prostitute; William Douglas, an eminent scientist and extortionist. Tension is maintained throughout the author's extensive coverage of the investigation and trial. A terrific work of crime reporting (despite a reference to "Mavil" Dewey of the decimal code).

I&#x2019;d been dreaming&#x2014;-rich colors, shapes, and places&#x2014;-but couldn&#x2019;t remember all the details. It didn&#x2019;t matter. I climbed out of bed and shuffled down the hallway. Rachel Swenson sat in an armchair by the front windows. The pup was asleep in her lap.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>She turned, face paled in light from the street, eyes a glittering reflection of my grief and guilt. &#x201c;Hey.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That dog can sleep anywhere.&#x201d; I pulled a chair close. Maggie slipped an eye open, yawned, stretched, and went back to sleep.<br><br>&#x201c;I should be staying at my place,&#x201d; Rachel said.<br><br>&#x201c;I like you here.&#x201d;<br><br>She tickled two bandaged fingers across the top of the pup&#x2019;s head and ran her eyes back toward the windows. Rachel was a sitting judge for the Northern District of Illinois. And one of the finest people I knew. She was also damaged. Because she was my girlfriend. Or, rather, had been.<br><br>&#x201c;I was going to make a cup of tea,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You want one?&#x201d;<br><br>She shook her head. I stayed where I was. And we sat together in the darkness.<br><br>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t sleep?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;Dreams.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded, and we sat some more.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the knife for, Rach?&#x201d;<br><br>She looked down at the knife tucked into her left hand. &#x201c;I got it from the kitchen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>Her gaze drifted to a small table and the slab of cheese that sat on it. &#x201c;You want a piece?&#x201d;<br><br>I shook my head. She held the blade up between us. &#x201c;You thought I was going to hurt someone?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just wondering about the knife, Rach.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; It had been almost a month since the attack. Most of the swelling in her face was gone&#x2014;-the bruises reduced to faint traces of yellow.<br><br>&#x201c;What did you dream about?&#x201d; she said.<br><br>&#x201c;I usually don&#x2019;t remember.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Usually?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes I get premonitions. Twice before. I wake up and feel certain things have happened.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;ve already happened, they&#x2019;re not premonitions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you going to make your tea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about them,&#x201d; she said, cutting off a small slice of cheese and nibbling at a corner.<br><br>&#x201c;The dreams?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The premonitions.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I got the first one when my brother died.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Philip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was seventeen. Woke up in the middle of the night and walked out to our living room.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I sat in front of the phone and stared at it for ten minutes until it rang. The warden told me he&#x2019;d killed himself. Hung himself in a cell with his bedsheet. But it wasn&#x2019;t anything I didn&#x2019;t already know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Second time was a couple years back&#x2014;-the night my father died.&#x201d;<br><br>I remembered my eyes opening, tasting the old man&#x2019;s passing like dry dust at the back of my throat. I pulled out the whiskey that night and filled a glass. Then I sat by the phone again until it rang.<br><br>&#x201c;And now?&#x201d; Rachel said.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the thing. I&#x2019;m not sure this time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I believe so, yes.&#x201d;<br><br>She got up from the chair and settled the pup on the couch. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make the tea.&#x201d;<br><br>I listened to her rattle the tap in the kitchen, then set the kettle. I got up and pulled a book off the shelf, Thucydides&#x2019;s History of the Peloponnesian War. It took me a moment to find the passage. Book 2, chapter 7. The historian&#x2019;s description of the Plague of Athens.<br><br>All speculation as to its origin and its causes . . . I leave to other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again. This I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its operation in the case of others.<br><br>I thought about Thucydides, surrounded by death, touched himself, scribbling down its essence for us to read twenty--four hundred years later. I&#x2019;d lied to Rachel. I knew what I feared. Knew why I feared it. I closed my eyes and they were there&#x2014;-two lightbulbs hanging in the darkness of the Chicago subway. Inside their glass skin, a question mark. Something the old historian himself might struggle to decipher.<br><br>The kettle began to whistle. On cue, the phone rang. Rachel watched from the doorway as I picked up. It wasn&#x2019;t a voice I expected to hear. And that was exactly what I expected. I listened without saying more than a word or two. Finally, the voice stopped talking&#x2014;-waiting, apparently, for a reaction.<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; I said. The voice told me.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there in an hour.&#x201d; I hung up. Rachel looked like she might speak, then turned away. Maggie was awake now and staring at me from the couch.<br><br>&#x201c;You want breakfast?&#x201d;<br><br>The pup&#x2019;s ears perked up at the last word. I walked toward the kitchen. She beat me there by the length of the living room.<br><br>&#x201c;Was it what you thought?&#x201d; Rachel handed me a mug of tea.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>I fed the dog. We both listened to her crunch away and then lick the bowl clean.<br><br>&#x201c;I have to go out,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t be here when you get back.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Rach . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stop.&#x201d; She raised her arm and touched her hand to her face, as if I were about to hit her. Then she turned and left. The pup followed. I walked back into the bedroom and got dressed. When I returned to the living room, Rachel was curled up on the couch.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll talk to you later,&#x201d; I said. She didn&#x2019;t respond. I was going to say more, but recalled the lessons of saying too much. So I left.<br><br>It was still dark out as I tramped down Addison. The first streaks of morning stained the Chicago night&#x2014;-fresh paint on an old canvas. Underneath, a city slept. Everywhere, it seemed, except in my dreams.

Regardless of the ever present risk of recapture, Tony Davis and his comrades enjoyed street parties and drinking binges with the cheerful Italians who were happy to be no longer fighting the British. <br><br>Repeatedly chased by the Germans, the tension mounts as the story reaches its dramatic climax, the little band never failing to maintain their wit and humor. When the Moon Rises is one of the classic escape stories of the Second World War.</p><p>Born in 1920, Tony Davies was educated at Mercer&#x2019;s School in the City of London. At the outbreak of war he joined the Honourable Artillery Company and was commissioned in the Regiment in 1940. He served in North Africa and Italy. After the war he studied medicine and, having qualified in 1953, practiced in Surrey.

Non-electrical signals (such as sound or vibration) can be converted to voltages and displayed. Oscilloscopes are used to observe the change of an electrical signal over time, such that voltage and time describe a shape which is continuously graphed against a calibrated scale. The observed waveform can be analyzed for such properties as amplitude, frequency, rise time, time interval, distortion and others. Modern digital instruments may calculate and display these properties directly. Originally, calculation of these values required manually measuring the waveform against the scales built into the screen of the instrument. The oscilloscope can be adjusted so that repetitive signals can be observed as a continuous shape on the screen. A storage oscilloscope allows single events to be captured by the instrument and displayed for a relatively long time, allowing human observation of events too fast to be directly perceptible. Oscilloscopes are used in the sciences, medicine, engineering, and telecommunications industry. General-purpose instruments are used for maintenance of electronic equipment and laboratory work. Special-purpose oscilloscopes may be used for such purposes as analyzing an automotive ignition system or to display the waveform of the heartbeat as an electrocardiogram. In response to the rapid advances in oscilloscope technology in the late 60&#39;s and early 70&#39;s, Clyde Herrick wrote a relevant state-of-the-art handbook about their applications offering almost all of the vital data and procedural instruction necessary for the beginning student and technician.</p><p></p><h2>The Cultural World of the Prophets, Year A: The First Reading and the Responsorial Psalm, Sunday by Sunday, Year A</h2><p><p>Preachers and liturgy planners will find <i>The Cultural World of the Prophets</i> a companion to John Pilch's <i>The Cultural World of Jesus Sunday by Sunday</i> series and <i>The Cultural World of the Apostles</i> series.

Or found some fudge in his mailbox? These are just a few of the mundane happenings Rylant places at the deity's feet. Through everyday events (like showers) to athletics (He falls 20 times while Rollerblading) to more shocking revelations (He gets arrested in a bar fight), God finds out what it is like to live like the rest of us. And guess what? He is just like one of us. He wants juice and comic books when He's sick. And through it all, God is surprised by these revelations. These short poems are visceral in their insight, and they shouldn't be considered blasphemous jokes as much as clever "what if?" ponderings. Has God just been "winging it" His whole life? Rylant has a carefully crafted response. Christian or private schools may find this collection inappropriate to their teachings, but read with an open mind and vivid imagination, it should speak to young people.

Best friends during their Missouri childhood, the passage of time, the thousands of miles between them, and the demands of family and careers have taken a toll on their friendship.

The London holiday presents them with more than a few surprises, becomes a journey of self-discovery and a chance to renew the bonds of friendship, and holds the promise of three new lives awaiting them.</p><p>In <i>London Holiday</i>, three middle-aged American women take a trip to London that changes their lives. Les, Julia, and Margo grew up together in a small Missouri town and have remained friends ever since childhood. They're all getting older and becoming increasingly dissatisfied with their lives. Les is a restless St. Louis society woman; Julia's a driven, single, interior designer; and Margo is a recently divorced schoolteacher. Les decides they all need to escape their lives for a while and go on an adventure together. It works wonders. On their first day in London, Julia takes off on her own and returns very late with a delightful story to tell: "I was picked up by a strange man in a south London slum who took me to a deserted barn in the country, and then a dying baronet thought I was the Duchess of Windsor." In other words, she went shopping for antiques and met a cute guy who might possibly be royalty. This book seems to be a fantasy specially designed for women of a certain age who particularly enjoy antiquing. The three friends stay in a beautifully decorated bed and breakfast run by a secretive, charming old woman named Mrs. Smith-Porter. Mrs. Smith-Porter has a knack for saying just the right thing to solve a problem then vanishing magically, which is a good thing because these women have plenty of problems. Les is stuck in a loveless marriage; Margo has just learned that her teenage daughter is pregnant and her former husband is gay; Julia is just plain lonely. England and Mrs. Smith-Porter improve these women's lives immeasurably. This is not a very profound book but it is rather fun, a good one to read at the beach. <i>--Jill Marquis</i><p></p>Born in Decatur, IIlinois, <b>Richard Peck</b> has written over 41 books for young readers.

Brother Ty, the narrator of <i>God Is My Broker</i>, has put them aside with a vengeance, and his task is all the more impressive when you consider just how many he used to possess. "I had traded the life of a Wall Street trader," he tells us, "for the contemplative life, my briefcase for a rosary, the roar of the trading floor for Gregorian chant." Hunkered down in a rural monastery, he seems finally to have escaped the iniquities of Mammon, along with rush-hour traffic and a major drinking problem.<p>A vow of poverty, however, isn't what it used to be. The monastery of Cana is falling to pieces. And Cana Nouveau--the wine the brothers have always produced to sustain themselves--has hit a new, undrinkable low. As the desperate abbot looks to Deepak Chopra and Anthony Robbins for advice, Brother Ty begins to get financial tips from the Supreme Insider: "That day God had revealed Himself to be our broker." Sometimes, of course, the Lord speaks in mysterious ways. Even a stray line from the Song of Solomon may encourage the narrator to take a flier on Apple Computer stock: "<i>Comfort me with apples</i>. It sounded like a 'buy' recommendation to me." By heeding his divine broker at every turn, however, Brother Ty manages to transform the monastery into a financial powerhouse. His story amounts to the funniest bit of ecclesiastical satire since J. F. Powers's <i>Morte D'Urban</i>. What's more, the authors send up the entire self-help industry with hilarious expertise, concluding <i>God Is My Broker</i> with what even Deepak Chopra would recognize as a home truth: "The only way to get rich from get-rich books is to write one."</p>With this latest work of fiction, a collaboration with <i>New York Times</i> writer, John Tierney, Christopher Buckley promises to be every bit as hilarious and witty as in his previous audiobook, <i>Thank You For Smoking.</i> In <i>God Is My Broker,</i> Buckley aims his sharp humor at the self-help gurus; and the likes of Stephen Covey, Anthony Robbins, and Deepak Chopra had better watch out.<br>Down to their last $304, the abbots in this story make a bunch of money playing the stock market--and then get carried away in today's commercialism and self-help principles when they begin to market their homemade wine. From redecorating their decrepit digs in the "peasant chic" style to outrageous television commercials to a "Cask-cade" water slide and artificial alp behind their monastery, (and passing off "decent Chilean table wine" as their own $16 a bottle brew) these monks will stop at nothing to get to the top of the wine business!<br><i>God Is My Broker</i> includes actual excerpts from the writings of Robbins, Chopra, and Covey, and lists hysterical questions about God, money, etc., that followers of the "progam" can ask themselves!</p><h2>God Hates You, Hate Him Back: Making Sense of The Bible (Revised International Edition)</h2><p>&#34;This book absolutely crucifies the argument for a benevolent creator.

The Daltons live in upstate New York.<br>A searing autobiography by one of rock 'n' roll's most tragic and romantic figures. A descendant of Austrian novelist Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, the beautiful Faithfull was discovered by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Oldham in 1964 and became an instant pop celebrity with her recording of the brooding ``As Tears Go By,'' a song Oldham asked Mick Jagger and Keith Richards to write for her. In a short time, Faithfull had become an internationally famous music and movie star, but she had little control over her image or artistic output. With the aid of rock biographer Dalton (Mr. Mojo Risin': Jim Morrison, the Last Holy Fool, 1991, etc.), she describes her struggle against the passive ``Angel Doll'' persona foisted on her by the press and her relationship to the Stones, especially Jagger, for whom she left husband John Dunbar in 1966. A dark romanticism- -what she calls a ``Walter Pater aestheticism,'' replete with flashes of everything from astrology to black magic--pervades the narrative, which is chock-full of encounters with pop legends (John Lennon is ``amusingly cruel''; Allen Ginsberg ``has never been hip''). Faithfull, who's had her own share of same-sex dalliances, suggests it was sexual tensions among the highly repressed Stones that gave them their manic energy: ``Who was the great love of [Jagger's] life? Actually, I think it was Keith.'' The tone is both compelling and pathetic as Faithfull details two decades of drug abuse and numerous lonely attempts to escape her addiction. From watching a lover commit suicide to recent singing and acting successes on her own terms, Faithfull has lived enough for three or four people--yet she is only 47. Despite some trite prose (``Things were happening so fast and we were changing with them''), this holds greater interest than any other recent book about the Stones and their circle.

His many Wycliffe novels were extremely popular and were adapted for a highly successful TV series starring Jack Shepherd. W.J. Burley died in 2002.Chief Superintendent Wycliffe at his most introspective as he confronts the murder, ineptly disguised as suicide, of Tony Miller, estate foreman of the Duloe estate, spread along the Fal river in Wycliffe's peaceful Cornish turf. Lord Hugh and Lady Cynthia Bottrell live in the shabby manor house, with Hugh's psychologist brother James, a bachelor, and lawyer Simon Lander, wife Beth, and daughter Jean occupying cottages on the grounds. The homosexual bond between Miller and Bottrell is soon uncovered, but more pressing is the disappearance of young Lizzie Biddick, a maid at the manor house, on the eve of her departure (with unexpectedly ample funds) for London. Wycliffe moves thoughtfully among these chatty neurotic characters, until events precipitate a crisis in which he manages to rescue yet another victim. Contrived motivation, unconvincing relationships, slow-motion pace, and a Wycliffe detached and sluggish add up to tepid stuff- -well below the Burley norm (Wycliffe and the Winsor Blue, etc., etc.). -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The Cripple Creek gold rush of 1891 created a need for railroads to serve this boom town which swelled to 50,000 souls nearly overnight and competed with Denver for the state capital. Here is the story of the standard-gauge railroad that made its way into the near-exclusive narrow-gauge domain of Colorado's Rocky Mountains. The Short Line utilized proven engineering methods to cut an impressive route to Cripple Creek. So impressive in fact that, when then Vice-president Theodore Roosevelt traversed the route in 1901, he is crediting with saying that it was a "trip that bankrupts the English language." When abandoned in the 1920s, the track was removed and the route was converted to the Corley Mountain Highway, an early tourism endeavor that survives today as the famous Gold Camp Road. With vintage ephemera. Illustrated throughout with black and white photos and fifteen color postcards. With detailed rosters of interurban electric cars and bibliography.

IN THE SHADE OF THE TEREBINTH appears to be a collection of short stories. But, that&#39;s not quite correct. In fact, it is a novel. A certifiably odd variety of the species, but a novel. Despite its thirteen tales and a cast of a hundred subplots, IN THE SHADE OF THE TEREBINTH tells just one story really: the story of a love which cannot be stopped. As for the &#34;night journey&#34; of the subtitle, the reader will recall the mystical journeys of biblical figures, or, for that matter, the tradition of Mohammed&#39;s nocturnal ascent through the heavens. But the attentive reader will also be reminded that all true stories are journeys and that all true journeys are occasions for disclosure; that the journey undertaken in darkness - even by way of a book - is often the occasion for the revelation of the greatest of all mysteries: the mystery of identity. Gabriel Meyer was born in Los Angeles in 1947. He studied piano and composition at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. Converting to Catholicism in 1956, he devoted his energies to various lay apostolates and an inter-denominational Christian community City of the Lord, which he helped found. A resident of Jerusalem for nearly six years, he became the Middle East correspondent for the National Catholic Register in 1986, with a focus on the indigenous churches of that region. Meyer reported extensively on religious and cultural issues in Israel, Turkey, and Egypt. His coverage of the Palestinian uprising, or intifada, won him Catholic Press Association awards in 1989. And in 1991, he won a California Writers Club prize for poetry. Reassigned to Yugoslavia in 1989, Meyer chronicled the religious and ethnic tensions which led to the disintegration of the country and the outbreak of war. He returned to the U.S. in 1991, where he continues to write and edit for the National Catholic Register.</p><p></p><h2>To Be a Drum</h2><p>Daddy Wes helps his children hear the rhythm of the earth. And with the rhythm begins a story of the &#34;drum,&#34; the pulse which has moved through the African people and through time and place.</p><p>Coleman is an Albert Whitman author.Grade 2-4AThis ambitious picture book celebrates the creativity and individuality of African Americans, beginning with the origin of human life when "the rhythm of the earth beat for the first people," filled the air with spirit, and flew into their bodies. This beat enables them to create actual and, possibly, symbolic drums. When the people are enslaved and carried to a new land where their "drums" are taken from them, they still feel the earth's beat in their bodies and become "living drums," and all of their skills and talents become symbolic instruments. Accomplishments in science, the arts, the military, and the Civil Rights Movement are referred to and the account ends with an exhortation to readers to find out how to beat out their own rhythms of the earth. The art is executed with thick paint, fabric collage, old buttons, fibers, clay and sand, and shreds of old baskets. The double-spread pictures run off the pages and compositions often swirl endlessly with no place for the eye to rest. Sometimes the backgrounds almost overpower the foregrounds. Images change from simple patchwork, to a misty scene, to thickly painted portraits, to simple washes. The picture of the creation of life with bold black outlines anchoring the portraits seems the most successful. Some readers may enjoy the poetic, inspirational text, but others may find the insistence on the drum metaphor and the relentlessly energetic art a bit overbearing.AMarilyn Iarusso, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Texan&#39;s Second Chance (Blue Thorn Ranch, 3)</h2><p><b>Wrangling Her Heart&nbsp;</b><br><br>There's a lot riding on Witt Buckton's fresh start in Martins Gap, Texas.

Rossbach and Leuthen are included in the Great Battles of History. Frederick made himself one of the Great Captains by these victories. Prussian military prowess became legendary.<br><br>But the Franco-German army swept away at Rossbach, and the Austrian army routed at Leuthen, were not only larger and had a fair share of professional soldiers, but the Austrians had beaten the Prussians not long before. So how were they so humiliated? What made Frederick Great?<br><br>For more than a century people believed it was because the Prussians were just naturally suited for war. Until 1945 many Germans, and their foes, remembered how Frederick miraculously saved Prussia against overwhelming odds, by marching through the snow towards Leuthen church.<br><br>As always it was not so simple. The expert on 18th century armies, Christopher Duffy, shows why French, Austrian and Reichsarmee soldiers, though often enough brave and skilful, marched to defeat, and how Frederick, often unaware of the legend he was creating, won these famous battles. But it is no longer left to myth, but to reliable accounts of hard fighting, quick decisions, and the fate of the soldiers and civilians swept up by the fighting.</p><p>As always it was not so simple.

Sunday paves the way with the most effective pairing: the author briefly describes reverence for the sun in Aztec, Egyptian, Babylonian, Greek and Roman cultures, and Constantine's designation of "Sun-day" as a Christian day of worship in 321 A.D.; then follows with the myth of Phaethon, son of the Greek sun god, Helios. Readers may have difficulty following the logic that links some of the other stories to their day (e.g., Tuesday was associated with Tiw, a Norse god of battle, but the tale that follows is that of Minerva--goddess of wisdom--and Arachne), and the range of cultures from which the myths originate is more limited here than in her previous title (two legends are from ancient Greece, two from Babylonia). But the etymologies and myths are illuminating nonetheless, and the book's closing pages brim with intriguing facts: how the 365-day year was created; the Aztec names for the first day of each week in a month (Rabbit, House, Flint and Cane); and a table highlighting the names of the seven days of the week in five languages. Hall (The Book of Animal Tales) customizes her palette and style to the various cultures depicted, yet her compositions possess a familiar storybook feel. The paintings wrap around many of the spreads, lending the informative collection a classical ambience.

Each entry is preceded by a history of the day's name and snippets of facts from a variety of cultures. The stories, though interesting and readable, do not always have direct connections to the days with which they are aligned. A few fit perfectly, such as "The Chariot of the Sun" for Sunday and "The Buried Moon" for Monday. The retellings, softened for young readers, keep the basic story lines intact. Hall's lively illustrations, with their saturated colors, clever use of light, and fantastical creatures such as winged horses, imps, etc., will delight readers. Gilchrist gives good information, though she neglects to mention sources; charts and related trivia are appended. Perceptive students will draw conclusions from the diverse connections presented, but average readers may get confused having to wade through the mention of so many cultures and calendars.

Read intimate accounts from company officials, dealers, and riders of classic Harley Davidson motorcyles of the 1930s. Hundreds of period photographs from private collections and massive text trace the development of the H-D Big Twin from the sidevalve VL to the &#39;61 and &#39;74 models, and the legendary Knucklehead. Experience the Milwaukee motorcycle scene from the men and women who lived it.</p><p>This significant era in the history of Harley-Davidson motorcycles marks the introduction of the "Knucklehead" overhead-valve engine model. Presenting a dramatic evolution in performance, reliability, and styling, the Knucklehead became the basis of all future Harleys and is considered to be the single most important Harley ever built. Based largely on interviews with Harley employees of the time, who also supplied most of the photographs used, this work by a Wisconsin-bred, lifelong motorcycle enthusiast and sometime motorcycle mechanic provides considerable detail about the development and impact of the Knucklehead. His work effectively places its context within such events as the Depression and the sweeping popularity of motorcycle clubs. Wagner provides insight into the culture of Harley riders and factory men. His narrative flows well, but glossy paper and very small type hinder reading. Nonetheless, this is an important source, not only for its in-depth focus on an obscure area but also for its use of primary sources. For public and academic libraries, especially in Wisconsin, where Harley-Davidson has been rooted since 1903.?David Van de Streek, Pennsylvania State Univ.

Coal smoke burst from the locomotive&#x2019;s stack in a drumstick plume that dusted the stars stippling the night sky. Inside the cab, the engineer slipped a silver Waltham watch from the pocket of his coveralls, sprung the lid and studied the face in the glow from the firebox. It was not the approaching storm that worried him, but the relentless crawl of time that sought to rob him of his precious schedule.<br><br>Gazing out the right side of the cab, he watched the creosote ties sweep under the eight huge driving wheels of the 2-8-0 Consolidation-type locomotive. Like the captain of a ship who lived with his command, he had been at the same throttle for three years. He was proud of &#x201c;Gallopin&#x2019; Lena,&#x201d; as he affectionately called the 236,000 pounds of iron and steel. Built by Alco&#x2019;s Schenectady Works in 1911, she was burnished in gloss black with a red stripe and her number 88 neatly hand-painted in gold.<br><br>He listened to the steel wheels pounding out a moving rhythm against the rail joints, felt the momentum of the locomotive and the seven cars that followed.<br><br>Then he pulled the throttle up another notch.<br>In the seventy-foot private Pullman that brought up the rear, Richard Essex sat at a desk in the vestibuled library. Too tired to sleep and bored with the tedium of the trip, he composed a letter to his wife to pass the time.<br><br>He described the ornate interior of the car, the elaborately carved Circassian walnut, the handsome brass electrical lamps, the red velvet revolving chairs and the potted palms. He even mentioned the beveled mirrors and ceramic tile floors in the lavatories of the four spacious sleeping compartments.<br><br>Behind him in a richly paneled observation parlor, five army guards in civilian dress played cards, the smoke from their cigars drifting in a blue cloud toward the brocade ceiling, their rifles laid casually about the furniture. Occasionally a player would lean over one of the brass spittoons dotting the Persian carpet. It was perhaps the highest level of luxury any of them had ever enjoyed, Essex speculated. The palatial transportation must have cost the government nearly seventy-five dollars a day, and all for the movement of a scrap of paper.<br><br>He sighed and finished his letter. Then he sealed it in an envelope, which he stuffed inside his breast pocket. Sleep still evaded him, so he sat and stared through the arched bay windows at the darkened landscape, listening for the wail of the engine&#x2019;s whistle just before a village depot or country crossing flashed past. Finally he stood up, stretched and walked to the elegant dining room, where he sat down at a mahogany table covered by a snowy cloth enhanced by crystal glasses and silver service. A glance at his watch told him it was a few minutes before two in the morning.<br><br>&#x201c;What is your pleasure, Mr. Essex?&#x201d; A black waiter had appeared as if by magic.<br><br>Essex looked up and smiled. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s quite late, but I wonder if I might get a light snack.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Happy to oblige, sir.

The shriek of steel and the cries of agony and terror beyond the darkness that smothered him were too hellish for reality. He struggled to retreat from the devilish scene and drift back into a peaceful sleep, but then the pain began gnawing at his senses and he realized it was no dream.<br><br>Somewhere below he could hear the rush of water as though it was surging through a tunnel, followed by a gust of wind that squeezed the breath from his lungs. He tried to open his eyes, but the lids felt glued shut. He was not aware that his head and face were coated with blood. His body was gripped in an immovable fetal position against cold, ungiving metal. An acrid electrical smell stung his nostrils and combined with the increasing pain to prod him onto a higher plateau of consciousness.<br><br>He tried to move his arms and legs, but they refused to respond. A strange silence settled around him, broken only by the murmur of lapping water. He made another attempt at breaking clear of the unseen vise that clutched him. He took a great breath and then exerted every muscle in his limbs.<br><br>Suddenly an arm tore free and he gasped as a jagged piece of metal sliced his forearm. The agony swept him to complete awareness. He wiped the congealing wetness from his eyes and gazed about what had once been his stateroom aboard the Canadian luxury liner bound for England.<br><br>The large mahogany dresser was gone, as was the writing desk and the nightstand. Where the deck and starboard bulkhead should have been was a massive cavity, and across the twisted edge there was only the fog-shrouded darkness and the black water of the St. Lawrence River. It was as if he was looking into a bottomless void. Then his eyes caught and focused on a soft reflection of white and he knew he was not alone.<br><br>Almost within touching distance a young girl from the next stateroom was buried in the debris with only her head and one pale shoulder protruding from the broken ceiling. Her hair was golden and rained in loose strands nearly three feet long. Her head was twisted at a grotesque angle and blood seeped from her lips, streaming down her face and slowly dyeing her cascading hair crimson.<br><br>Shields&#x2019; initial shock receded and a spreading sickness took its place. Until now the specter of death had not crossed his mind, but in the lifeless corpse of the girl he could read his own diminishing future. Then a sudden thought burst inside him.<br><br>In despair his eyes vainly probed the debris for the hand case he had never let out of his sight. It was gone, swallowed up in the wreckage. Sweat erupted from his every pore as he fought to extricate his torso from its prison. The effort was fruitless, there was no feeling below his chest and he knew with fearful certainty that his back was crushed.<br><br>Around him the great liner was in its death throes, rapidly listing and settling into the cold water that would forever be its grave. Passengers, some in evening dress, most in sleeping clothes, were milling about the slanting decks trying to climb into the few lifeboats that were launched or leaping into the cold river, clutching anything that would float. Only minutes remained before the ship would take her final plunge a scant two miles from shore.<br><br>&#x201c;Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>Shields stiffened and turned his head toward the faint cry that sounded from beyond the demolished partition separating him from the inside corridor. He listened intently, and then it came again.<br><br>&#x201c;Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In here,&#x201d; Shields shouted. &#x201c;Please help me.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no reply, but he heard sounds of movement through the pile of rubble. Soon a fallen piece of the ceiling was pushed aside and a face with a gray beard poked through.<br><br>&#x201c;My Martha, have you seen my Martha?&#x201d;<br><br>The intruder was in a state of shock and his words came hollow and without inflection. His forehead was badly lacerated and his eyes darted about frantically.<br><br>&#x201c;A young girl with long blond hair?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, my daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Shields motioned toward the body of the girl. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid she&#x2019;s gone.&#x201d;<br><br>The bearded man feverishly forced a larger opening and crawled through. He approached the girl, his face numb with uncomprehension, and lifted the bloodstained head, smoothing back the hair. For several moments he did not utter a sound.<br><br>&#x201c;She did not suffer,&#x201d; Shields offered gently.<br><br>The stranger did not reply.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Shields murmured. He could feel the ship listing sharply to starboard. The water was rising faster from below and there was little time left. He had to penetrate the father&#x2019;s grief and somehow persuade him to rescue the hand case.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you know what happened?&#x201d; he began.<br><br>&#x201c;Collision,&#x201d; the answer came vaguely. &#x201c;I was on deck. Another ship came out of the fog. Buried her bow in our side.&#x201d; The father paused, took out a handkerchief and dabbed the blood from the dead girl&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Martha begged me to take her to England. Her mother was reluctant, but I gave in. Oh God, if only I&#x2019;d known . . .&#x201d; His voice trailed off.<br><br>&#x201c;There is nothing you can do,&#x201d; Shields said. &#x201c;You must save yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>The father turned slowly and looked at him with unseeing eyes. &#x201c;I killed her,&#x201d; he whispered hoarsely.<br><br>Shields was not getting through. Anger smoldered within him and ignited in a flame of desperation.<br><br>&#x201c;Listen!&#x201d; he cried. &#x201c;Lost in the wreckage is a travel case with a document that must reach the Foreign Office in London!&#x201d; He was shouting now. &#x201c;Please find it!&#x201d;<br><br>The water swirled in small eddies a few feet away. The flood that would engulf them was only seconds away. The rising tide was stained with the slime of oil and coal dust while the night air outside was torn by the screams of a thousand dying souls.<br><br>&#x201c;Please listen to me while there is still time,&#x201d; Shields begged.<br><br>&#x201c;Your daughter is dead.&#x201d; He was beating at the restricting steel with clenched fists, uncaring of the pain as his skin shredded away. &#x201c;Leave before it&#x2019;s too late. Find my travel case and take it with you.

President Chaim Herzog of Israel praised it for being "rich in fascinating detail, and never losing sight of the great issues involved." Howard Sachar, writing in <em>The Washington Post Book World</em>, called it "magisterial." And John Gross of <em>The New York Times</em> hailed it as an "admirable new life of Weizmann--easily the most authoritative so far." Now, in <em>Chaim Weizmann: The Making of a Statesman</em>, Reinharz provides the long-awaited second volume.<br> This massively researched, deftly written narrative follows Weizmann's life from the beginning of the First World War through some of his greatest triumphs--the Balfour Declaration, the founding of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and the British Mandate for Palestine. Like the first volume, <em>The Making of a Statesman</em> combines intimate detail with incisive analysis. Reinharz untangles the internal politics of the World Zionist Organization as he charts Weizmann's rise to prominence. We see Weizmann struggling with fellow Zionists over his pro-British policies and his increasingly authoritarian leadership. We see him as a persuader and diplomat, a charming figure who could win influence in elite British circles without downplaying his Jewish identity or heritage. Reinharz offers fresh insights into Weizmann's brilliance as a chemist. No other historian has ever explained Weizmann's scientific accomplishments and their ties to his Zionist diplomacy. Reinharz follows the difficult negotiations that produced the triumphant Balfour Declaration. He carries the story through Weizmann's work in Palestine to found a vibrant Jewish community. Weizmann's largely unsuccessful efforts to open a friendly dialogue with the Arabs are also fully explored.<br> Chaim Weizmann was a towering figure of twentieth-century Zionism and the first president of the State of Israel. In every way, this monumental biography is worthy of this great statesman.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Jehuda Reinharz</strong> is Richard Koret Professor of Modern Jewish History, Director of the Tauber Institute for the Study of European Jewry, and Provost at Brandeis University. He is the author, editor or coeditor of numerous books including <em>The Letters and Papers of Chaim Weizmann, 1918-1920</em> and <em>Fatherland or Promised Land: The Dilemma of the German Jew, 1893-1914</em>.<br>"The second massive volume of a massive biography of Chaim Weizmann covers eight years in his life--but what years! It begins with the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 and ends with the ratification of the Mandate for Palestine by the new League of Nations in 1922....When the first<br>volume of this biography was published, it was widely hailed as an outstanding work, and various awards were bestowed on it.

A strong woman with a mind of her own, she would remain unknown to us were it not for her larger than life husband. Unlike other noted Reformation women, her primary vocation was not related to ministry. She was a farmer and a brewer with a boarding house the size of a Holiday Inn - and all that with a large family and nursing responsibilities. In many ways, Katie was a modern woman - a Lean In woman or a modern-day version of a Proverbs 31 woman. Katharina's voice echoes among modern women, wives and mothers who have carved out a career of their own.</p><p>Decisive and assertive, she transformed Martin Luther into at least a practicing egalitarian. Katharina was a full partner who was a no-nonsense, confident and determined woman, a starke Frau who did not cower when confronted by a powerful man.</p><p>Ruth Tucker invites readers to visit Katie Luther in her sixteenth-century village life - with its celebrations and heartaches, housing, diet, fashion, childbirth, child-rearing and gender restrictions - and to welcome her today into our own living rooms and workplaces.</p></p><p><p>Ruth A.

Officer T.J. Banks pulled the car onto the shoulder and flipped on the spotlight, running the beam along the edge of the field where corn stalks shivered in the cold. Twenty yards away, six Jersey cows stood in the bar ditch, chewing their cud.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows," he muttered. Besides chickens, they had to be the dumbest animals on earth.</p><p>He hit the radio. "Dispatch, this is forty-seven."</p><p>"What's up, T.J.?" asked Mona, the night dispatcher.</p><p>"I got a 10-54. Stutz's damn cows are out again."</p><p>"That's the second time in a week."</p><p>"Always on my shift, too."</p><p>"So what are you going to do? He ain't got no phone out there."</p><p>A glance at the clock on the dash told him it was nearly two A.M. "Well, I'm not going to stand out here in the frickin' cold and round up these stupid shits."</p><p>"Maybe you ought to just shoot 'em."</p><p>"Don't tempt me." Looking around, he sighed. Livestock on the road at this hour was an accident waiting to happen. If someone came around the curve too fast it could be bad. He thought of all the paperwork an accident would entail and shook his head. "I'll set up some flares then go drag his Amish ass out of bed."</p><p>"Let me know if you need backup." She snickered.</p><p>Yanking the zipper of his coat up to his chin, he slid his flashlight from its nest beside the seat and got out of the cruiser. It was so cold he could feel his nose hairs freezing. His boots crunched through snow as he made his way to the bar ditch, his breaths puffing out in front of him. He hated the graveyard shift almost as much as he hated winter.</p><p>He ran the flashlight beam along the fence line. Sure enough, twenty feet away two strands of barbed wire had come loose from a gnarled locust-wood post. Hoofprints told him several head had discovered the opening and ventured onto the shoulder for some illicit grazing.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows."</p><p>T.J. went back to the cruiser and popped the trunk. Removing two flares, he set them up on the centerline to warn traffic. He was on his way back to the cruiser when he spotted something in the snow on the opposite side of the road. Curious, he crossed to it. A solitary woman's shoe lay on the shoulder. Judging from its condition and lack of snow cover, it hadn't been there long. Teenagers, probably. This deserted stretch of road was a favorite place to smoke dope and have sex. They were almost as stupid as cows.</p><p>Frowning, T.J. nudged the shoe with his foot. That was when he noticed the drag marks, as if something heavy had been hauled through the snow. He traced the path with the flashlight beam, tracking it to the fence and into the field beyond. The hairs at the back of his neck prickled when he spotted blood. A lot of it.</p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p>He followed the trail into the ditch where yellow grass poked up through the snow. He climbed the fence and found more blood on the other side, stark and black against pristine white. It was enough to give a guy the willies.</p><p>The path took him to a stand of bare-branched hedge apple trees at the edge of a cornfield. He could hear himself breathing hard, the dead corn stalks whispering all around. T.J. set his hand on his revolver and swept the beam in a 360-degree circle. That was when he noticed the object in the snow.</p><p>At first he thought an animal had been hit and dragged itself there to die. But as he neared, the beam revealed something else. Pale flesh. A shock of darkish hair. A bare foot sticking out of the snow. Adrenaline kicked hard in his gut. "Holy shit."</p><p>For an instant he couldn't move. He couldn't stop looking at the dark circle of blood and colorless flesh. Giving himself a hard mental shake, T.J. dropped to his knees beside the body. His first thought was that she might still be alive. Brushing at the snow, he set his hand against a bare shoulder. Her skin was ice cold, but he rolled her over anyway. He saw more blood and pasty flesh and glazed eyes that seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Shaken, he scrambled back. His hand trembled as he grappled for his lapel mike. "Dispatch! This is forty-seven!"</p><p>"What now, T.J? One of them cows chase you up a tree?"</p><p>"I got a fuckin' body here at Stutz's place."</p><p><i>"What?"</i></p><p>They used the ten-code system in Painters Mill, but for the life of him he couldn't remember the number for a dead body. He'd never had to use it. "I said I got a dead body."</p><p>"I heard you the first time." But the words were followed by a stunned pause as realization hit her. "What's your twenty?"</p><p>"Dog Leg Road, just south of the covered bridge."</p><p>A beat of silence. "Who is it?"</p><p>Everyone knew everyone in Painters Mill, but he'd never seen this woman before. "I don't know. A woman. Naked as the day she came into this world and deader than Elvis."</p><p>"A wreck or what?"</p><p>"This was no accident." Setting his hand on the butt of his .38, T.J. scanned the shadows within the trees. He could feel his heart beating fast in his chest. "You'd better call the chief, Mona. I think we got us a murder."</p><p>SWORN TO SILENCE.

According to Stone&#x2019;s afterword, &#x201c;Pauline likes to do things her mom does, like type on a typewriter, and she doesn&#x2019;t like to wear dresses. She also really, really wants to get a fancy crown at the market on her birthday, but they don&#x2019;t have enough money...and Pauline throws a bit of a tantrum. Later, while her mom has a grownup birthday party for her, she runs away and jumps into a little boat. She rows out to sea. And all her family friends are searching for her. She sees all kinds of beautiful sights on her boat, but then things go terribly wrong, and Pauline needs to be rescued. In the end she is so glad for what she has, more than any crown to put on her head.

A master of the genre, Louise Erdrich has selected these pieces&#x2014;thirty works that first appeared in magazines as well as six unpublished stories&#x2014;from among a much larger oeuvre. She has ordered them chronologically but also by theme and voice.</p><p>Erdrich is a fearless and inventive writer. In her fictional world, the mystical can emerge from the everyday, the comic turn suddenly tragic, and violence and beauty inhabit a single emotional landscape. Each character in these stories is full of surprises, and the twists and leaps of Erdrich's imagination are made all the more meaningful by the deeper truth of human feeling that underlies them.</p><p>In "Saint Marie," the ardent longing that propels a fourteen-year-old Indian girl up the hill to the Sacred Heart Convent and into a life-and-death struggle with the diabolical Sister Leopolda fuels a story of breathtaking power and originality. "Knives" tells of a homely butcher's assistant, a devoted reader of love stories, who falls for a good-looking predator, a traveling salesman, with devastating consequences for each of them. "Le Mooz" evokes the stinging flames of passion in old age&#x2014;"Margaret had exhausted three husbands, and Nanapush had outlived his six wives"&#x2014;with unexpected humor that turns suddenly bittersweet at the story's close. A passion for music in "Naked Woman Playing Chopin" proves more powerful than any experience of carnal or spiritual love; indeed, when Agnes DeWitt removes her clothing to enter the music of a particular composer, she sweeps all before her and transcends mortality and time itself.</p><p>In <em>The Red Convertible</em>, readers can follow the evolution of narrative styles, the shifts and metamorphoses in Erdrich's fiction, over the past thirty years.

The layout is pleasing and easy on the eyes; there is plenty of color and decoration; and the table of contents indicates the origins of the tales. The large, dark print surrounded by pleasing white space delivers the stories in a simple, straightforward manner faithful to the different cultural traditions. There is a generic air to the volume, however. Originally published in France, it lists neither retellers nor translators. The border decorations are pedestrian and repetitive, while the full-page, full-color illustrations, though competently rendered in a cartoon style, are a bit crowded and unedifying. The characters' faces are particularly formulaic and lacking in expression. Most of the European standards are here, plus a few less-often anthologized selections (e.g., Andersen's "All's Well That Ends Well" and Perrault's "Ricky Tuftyhead"). A couple of the "Arabian Nights" tales are tossed in, as well.

This book gives an account of her life, and then goes on to analyse her theories about the workings of the human body in her own particular sphere, before concentrating on her advice about handling the delivery of a child (especially where it was problematic), her relationships with her clients and the way she uses them in case histories, her relations with some of the medical men of her time, and her recipes for a whole range of medical conditions in her book entitled Recueil des secrets. &nbsp;The study argues that Bourgeois was an educated, skilled midwife, very alive to the encroachment of medical men into an area which had always been the preserve of women. It shows that she had no scruples in attacking incompetent male pracitioners, and that she argued fiercely in her books that all practitioners, whatever their speciality, and whether their expertise was in academic theory or practical skills, should receive the recognition they deserved.</p><p>Wendy Perkins is Senior Lecturer in French at the University of Birmingham.<p>&#x201c;Louise Bourgeois was an important figure, in her lifetime and beyond, and her writings offer an unusual insight into an aspect of health care that is often difficult for historians to examine.

It begins with the pagan sex market of ancient Greece, and stresses the close connection of prostitution to everyday life in all countries at all times.<br><br> The author focuses on aspects often ignored by conventional historians; the relations not only between harlots and ordinary citizens, but among diplomats, artists, and prosperous courtesans - with the resulting ramifications in national and international affairs.<br><br> <i>The Oldest Profession</i> is a scholarly, fully detailed history that includes a wealth of remarkable anecdotes and presents a clear picture of the vicissitudes of prostitution; the efforts of early Romans to spy on the erotic Mysteries celebrated by women; Charlemagne's strict laws against prostitutes and procurers; twelfth-century England's regulated bawdy houses, which led to the establishment of official brothels in France and Italy and "women's quarters" in Germany; the sever punishment, both corporal and financial, of brothelkeepers in seventeenth-century France; the organized protest by prostitutes against the "brutal methods and language" of Paris police in the eighteenth-century; the twentieth-century abolition of the registration of prostitutes in Sweden, where there have never been brothels; and sex legislation in the Soviet Union, where prostitution is outlawed because it is "a means to live without working".</p><p></p><h2>The Atonement: The Origins of the Doctrine in the New Testament</h2><p>In recent years it has been increasingly suggested in some quarters that the doctrine of the atoning death of Christ did not come into being in the earliest stages of Christianity; the first interpretation of Jesus is said to have been the image of him as the eschatological prophet, or the innocent man suffering wrongly. Against such views which might seem to devalue the doctrine of the atonement, Professor Hengel argues forcefully and with great scholarship that the doctrine of the atonement can be traced back to the earliest church, indeed to the sayings of Jesus himself.<br>The second part of the book is devoted to this quest, moving back from the letters of Paul, through the pre-Pauline tradition, to Jesus. It is fascinating in itself. However, what gives the book even greater appeal is its first part, in which Professor Hengel examines a wider area of classical antiquity. Would it have made sense to Greeks and Romans of the first-century to say that Jesus had died for them? Were there points of contact in their traditions? Surveying Greek and Latin literature, Professor Hengel shows just how widespread a theme 'dying for' actually was, from Homer, through the Greek tragedians and orators, to Plutarch, Livy and Caesar.

Most libraries probably own several versions of the popular biblical story about Joseph, but this one is well told and particularly handsome. Wildsmith's ink-and-watercolor artwork has never seemed more polished, his colorings more carefully shaded (especially where the blue of the desert sky meets the gold of the sand). He also uses the Egyptian setting of pharaoh's court to beautiful effect, making it come alive with pyramids and hieroglyphic-encrusted walls and spires climbing to the sky.

Reisner believes that the achievement of this, the last great desert civilization, hinges on California&#x2019;s denial of its own inescapable fate. Both the Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas sit astride two of the most violently seismic zones on the planet. The earthquakes that have already rocked California were, according to Reisner, mere prologues to a future cataclysm that will result in destruction of such magnitude that the only recourse will be to rebuild from the ground up. Reisner concludes <b><i>A Dangerous Place</i></b> with a hypothetical but chillingly realistic description of such a disaster and its horrifying aftereffects.</p><p>&#x201c;If you are anxious about the safety of American cities, this book may give you a nervous breakdown.

The community of Selden was shocked because James Pierson had seemed such a regular guybluff, hearty, extrovertedand his family close-knit and happy. But it developed that his daughter and her boyfriend, Rob Cuccio, had hired a high school classmate, Sean Pica, to commit the murder because her father had been abusing her sexually since she was 12 and now, she feared, was about to repeat the pattern with her younger sister, JoAnn.

It is written for the Western, and primarily Christian, reader. The primary focus of the Book is on what is termed Sunni Islam, i.e., the Islam practiced by approximately 85-90% of the self-professed Muslims in the world. The Book is unique in several respects. It treats Islam from its own point of view. It is written by a natural-born American for the Western reader, and thus may avoid some of the cultural overlay that accompanies some books on Islam written by other Muslim authors. The author is an American who has practiced Islam both while living in America and in the Middle East, thus offering a broader perspective than would have otherwise been possible. As a convert from Christianity to Islam, and as a former ordained minister within Christianity, the author does a very good job of expounding the commonalties and contrasts of Islam with Judaism and Christianity, while still avoiding the temptation to distort Islam by interpreting it from within a Judaeo-Christian perspective. The reader is introduced to Islam almost exclusively through the two primary sources of Islam, i.e., the Qur&#39;an and the Sunnah, which are the only completely authoritative sources on Islam.</p><p></p><h2>How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method</h2><p>Heuristic- the study of the methods and rules of discovery and invention- has until our time been a largely neglected, almost forgotten, branch of learning. The disputed province of logic or philosophy or psychology, it tries to understand the process of solving problems and its typical mental operations. Today heuristic is undergoing a revival whose impetus is provided largely by Professor G. Polya&#39;s unique How to Solve It, the outstanding modern contribution to the study of problem solving. Though Professor Polya, an eminent mathematician, uses specific examples taken largely from geometry, his principal aim is to teach a method which can be applied to the solution of other problems, more or less technical. The particular solution of a particular problem is, for his purposes, of minor importance. The approach used in heuristic reasoning is constant regardless of its subject and can be expressed in simple but incisive questions. The &#34;Short Dictionary of Heuristic&#34; included in How to Solve It supplies the history, techniques, and terminology of heuristic with brilliant precision. For the Anchor Second Edition, Professor Polya has added a new concluding section of nineteenth Problems, Hints, and Solutions.</p><p></p><h2>Comin&#39; at Ya!: The Homoerotic 3-D Photographs of Denny Denfield</h2><p><p>An amazing collection of full-color, sexually explicit 3-D photographs of men taken in the early 1950s by Denny Denfield. Denfield was an amateur physique photographer in California who worked as an accountant for the US Army. His photographs, never distributed publicly given their illegality at the time, display a skill, wit, and daring rarely seen, and with their rich Kodachrome colors and mid-century decors, can now be appreciated for their roguish, almost na�ve charm.</p><p>The essay by David Chapman, from whose own private collection these photographs appear, sheds fascinating light on Denfield&#x2019;s secret life and work (stereography had been invented in 1850, but the advent of a compact, easy-to-use 3-D camera in 1947 allowed amateurs like Denfield to produce their own). A narrative by acclaimed writer Thomas Waugh (<i>Lust Unearthed</i>,<i> Out/Lines</i>,<i> Gay Art: A Historic Collection</i>) places Denfield&#x2019;s work in the historical context of homoerotic photography over the last century.</p><p>The 3-D photographs comprise dual images that &#x201c;come alive&#x201d; when viewed through the 3-D glasses, supplied with the book. Equal parts kitschy, informed, and sexy, <i>Comin&#x2019; at Ya!</i> is a collection that is both fun and historically fascinating.</p></p><p>David L. Chapman is the author of 11 previous books, including Comin? at Ya!: The 3-D Photographs of Denny L. Denfield (Arsenal 2007) and Adonis: The Male Physique Pin-up. He also writes for various bodybuilding magazines. He lives in Seattle. Thomas Waugh teaches film studies at Montreal?s Concordia University. He is a critic, public lecturer, and festival programmer, and is the author of the Lambda Award shorlisted Out/Lines and Hard to Imagine: Gay Male Eroticism in Photography and Film from their Beginnings to Stonewall. He also co-wrote the new edition of Gay Art with Felix Lance Falkon.<i>Comin' at Ya!</i> does away with the myth that the 1950s were boring.

Despite the allure, I found myself scrutinizing these strangers and the tableaus in which they stood, sprawled or reclined, wondering about the queer lives led in a bygone era. <br>&#x2015;<i>Xtra! West</i> (<i>Xtra! West</i> 2008-02-01)<br><br>Denfield's stereoviews meant to be viewed through 3-D glasses, a sturdy plastic pair of which are provided with the book don't just spontaneously step outside the sucked-in abs and strained muscles of physique pictorials into occasional messy, drunken hardcore. More successfully, they venture into atmospheric realms. This is especially the case in photos taken at Baker Beach and the nearby woods: rock formations and sun-dappled tree trunks and branches dramatically play off and sometimes even overshadow the human subjects. Furtiveness and a potent melancholic experience of the ephemeral are built into this adult version of the childhood ViewMaster experience.... Denfield's stereoview work might be richest when viewed as a light West Coast with an emphasis on the coastal answer to Alvin Baltrop's gay lib era photos of the piers in New York. Both photographers took their vision to the literal edges of America. <br>&#x2015;<i>San Francisco Bay Guardian</i> (<i>San Francisco Bay Guardian</i> 2008-02-12)<br><br>This new book of photographs is remarkable in a number of ways.... That fifty years later, the subjects still have the powers to get the hormones flowing attests, perhaps, to the universality of male beauty and desire over time and place.

These conversations, which began as private meetings, are now part of the Mind &amp; Life Institute and Mind &amp; Life Europe. This book documents a recent Mind &amp; Life Institute dialogue with the Dalai Lama and others on two fundamental forces: power and care&#x2015;power over and care for others in human societies.</p><p>The notion of power is essentially neutral; power can be used to benefit others or to harm them, to build or to destroy. Care, on the other hand, is not a neutral force; it aims at increasing the wellbeing of others. Power and care are not incompatible: power, imbued with care, can achieve more than a powerless motivation to care; power, without the intention to benefit others, can be ruthless. The contributors&#x2015;who include such celebrated figures as Frans B. M. de Waal, Olafur Eliasson, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, and Jody Williams&#x2015;discuss topics including the interaction of power and care among our closest relatives, the chimpanzees; the effect of meditation and mental training practices on the brain; the role of religion in promoting peace and compassion; and the new field of Caring Economics.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Paul Collier, Brother Thierry-Marie Courau, Frans B.

Children&#39;s BOMC Main. Jr Lit Guild.</p><p>The utterly winsome Sammy (and his crabby, TV-narcotized sister) is featured in a fine little story from Whybrow (The Snow King, p. 806, etc.) about the pleasures of friends who happen to be of a different species. Up in the attic with his grandmother, Sammy comes across a box full of old dinosaur toys. He shuttles the box downstairs, doctors the dinosaurs that need doctoring, bathes and buffs them all, and then, next day, trundles to the library to discover their names. While this is going on, captured in handsome pen-and-wash artwork, the beasts shuffle about, but only to Sammy's knowledge. When every one of them is properly bestowed with a nameanchisaurus, brontosaurus, scelidosaurus, etc.the dinosaurs say, `' `Thank you, Sammy.' They said it very quietly, but just loud enough for Sammy to hear.'' Now fast friends, they nonetheless become separated when Sammy inadvertently leaves them on the train. Sammy is deeply unhappy; he inquires after them at the station, but the ``Lost and Found'' man says, ``How do we know they are your dinosaurs?'' A blind-identification test confirms that fact: `' `All correct!' said the man. `These are definitely your dinosaurs! Definitely!' `' Quietly, the dinosaurs concur: `' `You're definitely our Sammy. Definitely!' `' This is a beautiful, cheering story full of offbeat charm. (Picture book. 3-6) -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>PreSchool-Grade 2 This imaginative story about a young boy and the dinosaurs that he finds in his grandmother's attic is a delight from endpaper to endpaper. Sammy washes the little toys, repairs them, and finds a special bucket for them to live in. He goes to the library to identify them, and begins to take them everywhere he goes. They go to the beach and to the garden store, and take baths together. The dinosaurs even begin to talk to the child, but only he can hear them. One day, the small creatures are left behind on the train. Sammy is devastated, until Gran takes him to the train station's lost and found. He calls to each of his dinosaurs, and they return to him.

"Actress in the House" is his eighth novel-his first in twelve years-a provocative and imaginative work that explores the mysterious interaction of memory, abuse, love, and violence. <br> Struck in the face, the actress on stage is staggered but doesn't fall. She gazes into the audience, staring with bloody nose at the middle-aged man in the eighth row of this obscure downtown warehouse theater who is drawn in by this violence unmistakably over the line. Daley has never set eyes on this actress before, yet is not entirely unacquainted with her either. Almost against his will, her life will invade his, her efforts to break free of those who have tried to control her, and worse. <br> As Becca and Daley begin the uncertain process of discovering one another, talking surprisingly, absorbingly, with a humor and uncanny closeness on the night streets of mid-1990s New York, they slowly unearth the events-both past and present-that have brought them together and may tear them apart.</p><p>Joseph McElroy is the author of eight acclaimed novels, including <i>A Smuggler's Bible</i>, <i>Hind's Kidnap</i>, <i>Ancient History</i>, <i>Lookout Cartridge</i>, Plus, <i>Women and Men</i>, and <i>The Letter Left to Me</i>.After a 14-year hiatus, McElroy (The Letter Left to Me) breaks his silence with a hefty novel that explores the tangled themes of love, obsession, desire and destiny through the interwoven lives of a small circle of friends and acquaintances in contemporary New York City. This convoluted story begins with an actress being slapped viciously by a fellow actor during a performance of a play at a theater in lower Manhattan, an act that binds the fates of Becca, the victim, and Daley, an audience member whose sympathetic gaze meets hers as she reels from the assault. Although the connection between the pair that night is fleeting, Becca soon kindles a relationship when she requests that Daley, a lawyer, handle her eviction case. In the following months, a bond between this unlikely couple grows by zigs and zags, conjured through McElroy's narrative wizardry, his startling images and his keen ability to approach pivotal scenes from a variety of angles. Daley's obsession with the fair-haired actress with the imperfect nose is rendered in brief omniscient flashes, with McElroy painstakingly showing, at a pace that closely imitates real time, how love evolves and deepens. McElroy's electrically charged narrative explores many forms of violence-physical, verbal, emotional and psychological. His attempts to give ordinary events a fateful resonance can sometimes seem strained, and the slow pace of the narrative may put off some readers, but those who persevere will find a rewarding conclusion. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Monkey King # Volume 01 : Birth of the Stone Monkey</h2><p>Monkey King is a twenty-volume comics series based on the legendary Chinese novel The Journey to the West. It is a magisterial work that took seventy people over six years to complete. The Journey to the West is at once a comedy, a drama, a satire, a meditation on faith and discipline, and a fantastical dramatization of China's history. Its creation covers many centuries and several dynasties. Begun during the Song Dynasty (10th~13th century), Journey is set against the backdrop of the 7th century Tang Dynasty, and tells the story of a priest named San Zang, who introduces China to the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures of India, and his trio of disciples: the monkey king Sun Wu Kong, the gluttonous pig Zhu Bajie, and the quiet but noble sea monster Sha Wu Jing. The San Zang who appears in Journey to the West is a specialist in Tripitaka, and is based on a real priest, named Xuan Zang. Xuan Zang lived from 602 to 664, and have traveled the western lands and traded with other countries along the western border from 627 or 629 to 645. More than three hundred years later, a story based on Xuan Zang's adventures, first appeared. The Journey to the West originated from this story. The Song Dynasty was founded in 960, yet because the only known author of Journey to the West, Wu Cheng en, died in 1582, during the Ming Dynasty, the story is considered the result of collective creation spanning five hundred years. The story also traveled through several countries and includes at least four different timelines. The events of Journey to the West, which include epic battles and threatened palaces and imperiled kings, could resonate with readers during almost any age, but the story focuses on portraying a peaceful society where deviance is ultimately trumped by enlightenment, violence defeated by benevolence. It is this balance, between depicting familiar events of conquest and telling a story about the search for truth, that makes The Journey to the West so beloved today. The author, Mr. Wei Dong Chen, is a highly acclaimed and beloved Chinese artist and an influential leader in the New Chinese Cartoon trend. His company, Creator World in Tianjin, is the largest comics studio in China. He has published hundreds of cartoons, which have been recognized for their strong literary value throughout the world. In 2005, he undertook the monumental effort of translating four classic Chinese novels into serialized comic form. After six years of great and enthusiastic work, he completed his dream, which now consists of 12,800 pages of beautiful drawings and epic storytelling. Monkey King is one of the four novels. Monkey King is a new landmark of comic artistry in China, and is a bold and exhilarating treatment of one of the definitive works of Chinese literature. <br><br> Vol. 1 Birth of the Stone Monkey <br> Cited as one of the greatest Chinese novels, MONKEY KING (The Journey to the West) follows the adventures of Sun Wu Kong, born from a stone on Spring Mountain and given the title of the Handsome Monkey King, who seeks to learn the secret of eternal life. Under the tutelage of the Buddhist Master Puti, Sun Wu Kong becomes incredibly powerful, but his hubris grows until he has run afoul of the gods, who dispatch an army to Spring Mountain to subdue the Monkey King, who has declared himself the Emperor of Heaven.</p><p>Wei Dong Chen, a highly acclaimed and beloved artist, and an influential leader in the New Chinese Cartoon trend, is the founder of Creator World in Tianjin, the largest comics studio in China. Recently the Chinese government entrusted him with the role of general manager of the Beijing Book Fair, and his reputation as a pillar of Chinese comics has brought him many students. He has published more than four hundred cartoons, which have been recognized for their strong literary value not only in Korea, but in Europe and Japan, as well. Free spirited and energetic, Wei Dong Chen s positivist philosophy is reflected in the wisdom of his work. He is published serially in numerous publications while continuing to conceive projects that explore new dimensions of the form.Journey to the West, considered one of China&#x2019;s greatest classical novels, has been retold countless times, including as a segment in Gene Luen Yang&#x2019;s American Born Chinese (2006). This more straightforward adaptation has an even younger target audience. Born from a rock perched atop Spring Mountain, Handsome Monkey King enjoys life so much that he wishes it would never end. Traveling east in search of the secret to immortality, he becomes a disciple of Master Puti, who teaches him not only that secret but the secret to 72 transformations and how to travel by cloud. Now called Sun Wu Kong, the Monkey King returns to Spring Mountain and begins forming alliances with the surrounding kingdoms, eventually becoming strong enough to take on the Jade Emperor himself. Written and illustrated as a heroic action story, with all the humor and drama left in, this is as engaging for readers of history and folklore as it is for fans of wisecracks and fighting. An introduction and appendix are included, making the story even easier to follow for readers unfamiliar with the original tale.

With songs like &#x201c;The Weight,&#x201d; &#x201c;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Up on Cripple Creek,&#x201d; he and his partners in The Band fashioned music that has endured for decades, influencing countless musicians. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this captivating memoir, written over five years of reflection, Robbie Robertson employs his unique storyteller&#x2019;s voice to weave together the journey that led him to some of the most pivotal events in music history.

It&#x2019;s the story of exciting change as the world tumbled through the &#x2bc;60s and early &#x2bc;70s, and a generation came of age, built on music, love, and freedom.

On the surface, this book is a profound and intelligent discussion of where mysticism and parapsychological science intersect. But at its core, this is a tender book about living a life of peace and feeling connected to universal love. In the opening chapters, the authors address the illusion that we are separate from other beings--one that has tainted our scientific and spiritual models for decades. From here the authors move into scientific evidence for mind-to-mind and spirit-to-spirit connections and how to experience this "oneness" (or, as the title suggests, how to experience God) through freeing the heart and quieting the mind.<p> Their most groundbreaking chapter is "Why Scientists Pray," in which the authors challenge the stereotype of the cold, unfeeling scientist and show us just how dedicated and spiritual the heart of a scientist can truly be. This is an especially supportive book for contemporary scientists who are trying to break out of the current mold and create a more mystical and intuitive approach to inquiry. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p></p><h2>Uncommon Threads: Wabanaki Textiles, Clothing, and Costume</h2><p><i>Uncommon Threads</i> celebrates the textile arts of the Wabanakis, the indigenous people living between the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Gulf of Maine. Known geographically as the Maritime Peninsula, the region falls in both the United States and Canada. For millennia, textiles have played a vital role as Native communities have expressed and maintained their identity. This large and distinctive body of Wabanaki artifacts challenges stereotypes about Native textiles and clothing that are based on more familiar styles from better known regions of North America.<br><br>For Wabanakis, textiles have long been a rich and important medium. They record how, beginning in the seventeenth century, an indigenous people coped with a rapidly expanding alien culture that surrounded them. The Wabanakis defined their view of this new world through their clothing and costume. For all cultures, important occasions and life events demand special clothes that communicate messages to the viewer. By examining Wabanaki costume, including specific styles and decorative ornament, one can find information that illuminates the history of the Wabanakis, their means of communication, and the ways they coped with a rapidly changing world.</p><p>"Beautiful objects, beautiful book! It is a joy to see textiles assume their rightful place in the Wabanaki story and in the larger history of an almost forgotten borderland." - Laurel Thatcher Ulrich, author of <i>The Age of Homespun: Objects and Stories in the Creation of an American Myth</i><b>Bruce J.

The last time that happened&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Before she could finish the sentence, Jack jumped up. &#x201c;Dad, Annie and I are going to go outside for a while!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Can the hot chocolate wait till we get back?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure, have fun!&#x201d; their dad called from the kitchen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I have to get my pack,&#x201d; Jack said to Annie. &#x201c;Meet you on the porch.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget the rhyme book!&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Annie slipped outside and Jack ran up to his room. He grabbed his backpack. He checked to make sure their book of magic rhymes was inside. <i>Good</i>, there it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack charged back downstairs. He pulled on his boots, put on his jacket, tied a scarf around his neck, grabbed his mittens, and headed out the door.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack could see his breath in the cold air. &#x201c;Brrr,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s hurry!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack and Annie ran down the street and into the Frog Creek woods. They wove between the trees, their boots crunching through the fallen leaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack stopped. The magic tree house was back. High in a tall oak tree, it was silhouetted against the gray November sky. &#x201c;You were right,&#x201d; he said to Annie. &#x201c;Good work.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Annie said. She ran to the rope ladder and started up. Jack followed her.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> When they climbed inside the tree house, Jack and Annie saw a book and a scroll of parchment paper lying on the floor. Annie picked up the scroll, unrolled it, and read aloud.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Dear Jack and Annie of Frog Creek,</i><br> <i>I am sending you on one more mission to prove that you can use magic wisely. This poem will guide you.</i><br> <i>&#x2014;M.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The very last unicorn </i><br><i> Is now hidden well</i><br><i> By those who have put him </i><br><i> Under a spell.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Four centuries, four decades </i><br><i> From that afternoon,</i><br><i> At the end of November, </i><br><i> Before the blue moon,</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> He will wake once more </i><br><i> And be free to go home </i><br><i> If you call out his name: </i><br><i> Divine Flower of Rome.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> You must coax him to stand </i><br><i> Once his name is spoken.</i><br><i> His chain will break</i><br><i> And the spell, too, be broken.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> Then a young girl must love him </i><br><i> And show him the way,</i><br><i> Lest he be trapped forever </i><br><i> On public display.</i><br> &nbsp;<br><i> If he loses this chance </i><br><i> To rise and depart, </i><br><i> All magic will fade</i><br><i> From his horn and his heart.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A unicorn!&#x201d; breathed Annie. &#x201c;I love him already. <i>I&#x2019;ll</i> show him the way!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But this poem is really hard to understand,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;What kind of research book did Morgan send us?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> He picked up the book that had been left for them by Morgan le Fay, the librarian of Camelot. The cover showed a row of skyscrapers. The title was <i>New York City Guide Book, 1938</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;New York City?&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;I love New York City! Remember the great time we had there with Aunt Mallory?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah, I love it, too,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;But why would there be a unicorn in New York City in 1938? A unicorn is an ancient fantasy creature. New York City&#x2019;s a real place, and 1938 is not even that long ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;It sounds like a hard mission. But don&#x2019;t forget we have Teddy and Kathleen&#x2019;s magic rhymes to help us.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Jack. He pulled out the book given to them by their friends Teddy and Kathleen, two young enchanters of Camelot. &#x201c;The problem is, we can only use each rhyme once, and we&#x2019;ve already used seven out of the ten.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Which means we still have three left,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;What are they?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;<i>Pull a Cloud from the Sky</i>,&#x201d; said Jack. <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Cool,&#x201d; said Annie.<br> &#x201c;Yeah, it is,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m not sure it will be much use.&#x201d; He looked back at the book. &#x201c;<i>Find a Treasure You Must Never Lose</i>,&#x201d; he said. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a really good one!&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;The unicorn&#x2019;s a treasure. So that rhyme could<br> take care of our whole mission.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But it only partly fits,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;You could call the unicorn a treasure. But once we find him, we have to lose him. He has to go back home.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Oh, right... ,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;What else?&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Your favorite,&#x201d; said Jack. &#x201c;<i>Turn into Ducks</i>.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> Annie laughed. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to use that one!&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I hope we <i>never</i> use that one,&#x201d; said Jack. He didn&#x2019;t want to waddle around and quack like a duck. &#x201c;These leftover rhymes don&#x2019;t seem very helpful to me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, let&#x2019;s just wait and see,&#x201d; said Annie. &#x201c;But now . . . &#x201d; She held up Morgan&#x2019;s research book and smiled.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack nodded. &#x201c;New York City, here we come,&#x201d; he said. He pointed at the book&#x2019;s cover. &#x201c;I wish we could go <i>there</i>!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The wind started to blow.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The tree house started to spin.

His boundless enthusiasm for this country's rich and varied landscape, and the watercraft that allowed him to explore it, help lift from the page these exceptional paintings. Known primarily for his work as a filmmaker, author and canoeist, Mason spent a lifetime sketching and painting the rivers, lakes, waterfalls, marshlands, cliffs and campsites that he loved. They appear here in all weather, in all seasons. Most of the paintings featured in this book are impressionistic, some are realistic; in each painting, Mason sought to create images that would reveal new insights with repeat viewing. </p></p><p>Bill Mason</p><h2>Fall of a Philanderer (Daisy Dalrymple Mysteries, No. 14)</h2><p>In the summer of 1924, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher is off on a summer holiday by the sea with her step-daughter Belinda and Belinda&#39;s chum Deva, and her husband, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard. Daisy is anticipating a relaxing, non-dramatic holiday. But Daisy doesn&#39;t have that kind of luck. It seems that a local low-rent Don Juan has been busily seducing the local womanfolk and, in a town this small, no secret is kept for long. A fact that is amply illustrated when the Fletcher&#39;s simple picnic is interrupted by the discovery of a broken body at the foot of the cliff--that of the philandering local innkeeper of bad memory. Like Jacqueline Winspear&#39;s much praised novels about Maisy Dobbs, Carola Dunn vividly evokes the life and times of 1920&#39;s England wrapped in a classic mystery to delight her many fans.</p><p>In the summer of 1924, the Honourable Daisy Dalrymple Fletcher has planned a quiet, relaxing holiday in the small costal town of Westcombe. With her husband, Detective Chief Inspector Alec Fletcher of Scotland Yard, planning to join them later, Daisy went ahead with her step-daughter Belinda and Belinda&#x2019;s chum Deva. Currently three months pregnant, Daisy is looking forward to a relaxing, non-dramatic vacation of quiet strolls along the cliffs and days down at the beach. But Daisy doesn't have that kind of luck and the seemingly quiet seaside town turns out to be a small hotbed of rumor and scandal. It seems much of it is centered around local lothario George Enderby &#x2013; the married owner of the local pub &#x2013; who keeps himself busy attempting seduction of whatever women cross his path. And in a town this small, no indiscretion remains secret for very long.&nbsp; Which is clearly illustrated when the husband of one of his rumored conquests assaults the innkeeper in full view.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The last vestige of the idyllic vacation dissipates shortly thereafter when the Fletchers, planning a simple picnic, discover Enderby&#x2019;s broken body at the foot of a sea cliff.&nbsp; With murder the most obvious conclusion, Alec&#x2019;s vacation is cut short by the official investigation.&nbsp; But it is up to Daisy to uncover the truth lurking behind the rumors, gossip, and closely held secrets of this small town if the killer is ever to be found.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>(continued on back flap)</i><br><i>(continued from front flap)</i><br>[back flap copy]<br>Author photo: yes (must attach)<br>Author Photo credit: Kent Peterson Photography<br>&nbsp;<br>[Carola Dunn is the author of several previous mysteries featuring Daisy Dalrymple as well as numerous historical novels.&nbsp; Born and raised in England, she lives in Eugene, Oregon. ]<br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br>]Carola Dunn is the author of many previous mysteries featuring Daisy Dalrymple.

He reminds us that a decade ago the Chechens were demanding nothing more than many other small peoples at the time of the Soviet breakup&#x2014;statehood and a new start. In a world of cynicism and ignorance, Wood offers facts that many will find inconvenient and lays out an argument for which many thousands of Chechens&#x2014;mistakenly or not&#x2014;suffered and gave their lives.&#x201d;&#x2014;Sebastian Smith</p><h2>Gardens of Silihdar: A Memoir</h2><p>From her earliest years until her tragic death, Zabel Yessayan championed social justice and women&#39;s rights.

Yessayan authored several novels, short stories, newspaper articles an eyewitness account of the aftermath of the 1909 massacres of the Armenians. Her 1935 memoir, The Gardens of Silihdar, is a poignant narrative of her childhood and a vivid account of Armenian community life in Constantinople (Istanbul) at the end of the nineteenth century.

He is the author of Lights Out for the Territory, Landor&#39;s Tower, White Chappell Scarlet Tracings, Downriver, Lud Heat and Radon Daughters.At first glance, this may appear to be only a book of observations about walking alongside the M-25, the roughly 150-mile highway that encircles London, but it is actually a complex, literary meditation on crime, urban sprawl, the effect of automobiles, British politics, the relationship between history and modernity, and perhaps not least, the importance of good footwear. Sinclair (Lights Out for the Territory) writes in a hyper, staccato style that in a single passage can run the gamut from Beat poetry ("Narrative fractured. Verbals didn't stand up. Confessions wouldn't cohere. The motorway was loud with Chinese whispers") to the paranoid, embellished worldview of Hunter S. Thompson ("When dusk fell, villains took to their [borrowed-without-the-owner's-consent] cars. On the cruise. Tooted up with hand guns, machetes, petrol cans, monkey wrenches"). As with Thompson, one gets the sense that Sinclair's hyperbolic descriptions get at the truth better than a more conventional portrayal ever could. Sinclair is an artist with no patience for cheesy development, shopping malls or the very highway on which he walks, slicing past beautiful countryside and abandoned factories alike. The writing is often enjoyable, but at times heavy-handed and replete with references that will escape those not conversant in British culture: "An excuse to sample oysters in Whitstable (Notting Hill prices)," he writes, "to swim at Walberswick (Southwold: the new Hampstead)." The book is both fascinating and exhausting, and readers will find themselves rewarded even if they need to put it down frequently just to stretch their legs.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>American Art Series: Maxfield Parrish</h2><p>A look at the life and work of one of the best and most successful artists who worked in magazine illustration features eighty-five full-color and ten black-and-white reproductions of his work.</p><p>Maxfield Parrish (1870-1966) has long been considered one of the greatest American illustrators of the 20th century and lived and worked throughout his career in Cornish Hills, New Hampshire. In early 1920's when his works <i>Garden of Allah </i>and <i>Daybreak</i> were reproduced as art prints, he quickly became one of the best known artists in America. His unmistakable paintings?characterized by 'Parrish Blue' water and skies, luminescent rocks and hills, and exquisite young women draped in flowing, classically inspired garments?are infused with a romantic Eden-like quality so entrancing that today's reproductions elicit the same infectious enthusiasm as when the prints first appeared.<br>In the 1920's, one out of four American homes had his world of make-believe hanging on their walls. A survey taken in 1925 in America showed that Van Gogh, C�zanne and Parrish were thought to be the three greatest artists of all time and Parrish's art images on posters, calendars, magazine covers, and book illustrations have made his name a household word thereafter.<br>Today, Parrish's art works are in the collections of many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, and his work is once again experiencing an enthusiastic revival. Parrish's painting <i>Daybreak</i>, one of the most reproduced art images in history, recently sold for $4.3 million, setting a record price for an illustration and Parrish art prints rank among the most popular in the world and are distributed in 42 countries. The Image Exchange on America Online reported in January, 1997 that as many as 4,800 people accessed the Maxfield Parrish exhibition on the Internet in a single day.Maxfield Parrish (American, 1870-1966), enjoyed a popularity unmatched in the twentieth-century art world. His art prints had an enormous impact on popular American culture, appearing in one out of four households. His images were reproduced everywhere--as illustrations in children's books and in such leading periodicals as <i>Scribner's Magazine</i>, <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i>, <i>Hearst's Magazine</i>, and <i>Harper's Weekly</i>; as advertisements for everything from bicycles to Jello (tm) and tires to chocolates; as greeting cards; as calendars for, among others, General Electric Edison Mazda Lamps for almost two decades; even as menus and toys. His most successful paintings feature beautiful women posed thoughtfully against dramatic landscapes, and they remain even today among the best-loved works of any American artist.</p><h2>Bear in Pink Underwear</h2><p>The star of <em>Bear in Underwear</em> is back in another zany adventure, this time on the soccer field.

This excellent anthology by Reneaux helps plug that inexplicable gap. Reneaux, a noted storyteller and a Cajun herself, retells 27 tales she heard in childhood from relatives or has heard since from fellow Cajuns. Their folklore is as spicy and interesting as their famed food and reflects a variety of flavors and influences. The story of Lapin and his theft of honey from Bouqui, for instance, is a Cajun favorite and is clearly recognizable as one of the contests between Brer Rabbit and Brer Fox. Likewise, the aetiological tale of why alligators hate dogs is reminiscent of Native tradition. The author tells a wide variety of tales--animal stories, ghost stories, fairy stories. One of the best relates the Hansel and Gretel-like story of Catafo and his brothers, who out-smart their devilish host. Another perhaps also familiar one tells of the ghost of the renowned pirate Jean Lafitte trying to free himself of his cursed treasure. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lullaby and Goodnight: A Bedtime Book With Music</h2><p>The verses of Brahms&#39; Lullaby are fully illustrated in this bedtime book complete with a musical accompaniment that plays with the pull of a tab</p><p></p><h2>Forbidden Voice Reflections of a Mohawk</h2><p>Forbidden Voice is descended from a long line of Mohawk chieftans.

To begin with, Giovanni is ten years younger than I am, and, like most Italian guys in their twenties, he still lives with his mother. These facts alone make him an unlikely romantic partner for me, given that I am a professional American woman in my mid-thirties, who has just come through a failed marriage and a devastating, interminable divorce, followed immediately by a passionate love affair that ended in sickening heartbreak. This loss upon loss has left me feeling sad and brittle and about seven thousand years old. Purely as a matter of principle I wouldn't inflict my sorry, busted-up old self on the lovely, unsullied Giovanni. Not to mention that I have finally arrived at that age where a woman starts to question whether the wisest way to get over the loss of one beautiful brown-eyed young man is indeed to promptly invite another one into her bed. This is why I have been alone for many months now. This is why, in fact, I have decided to spend this entire year in celibacy.</p><p>To which the savvy observer might inquire: 'Then why did you come to <i>Italy</i>?'</p><p>To which I can only reply&#x2014;especially when looking across the table at handsome Giovanni&#x2014; 'Excellent question.'</p><p>Giovanni is my Tandem Exchange Partner. That sounds like an innuendo, but unfortunately it's not. All it really means is that we meet a few evenings a week here in Rome to practice each other's languages. We speak first in Italian, and he is patient with me; then we speak in English, and I am patient with him. I discovered Giovanni a few weeks after I'd arrived in Rome, thanks to that big Internet caf� at the Piazza Barbarini, across the street from that fountain with the sculpture of that sexy merman blowing into his conch shell. He (Giovanni, that is&#x2014;not the merman) had posted a flier on the bulletin board explaining that a native Italian speaker was seeking a native English speaker for conversational language practice. Right beside his appeal was another flier with the same request, word-for-word identical in every way, right down to the typeface. The only difference was the contact information. One flier listed an e-mail address for somebody named Giovanni; the other introduced somebody named Dario. But even the home phone number was the same.</p><p>Using my keen intuitive powers, I e-mailed both men at the same time, asking in Italian, "Are you perhaps brothers?"</p><p>It was Giovanni who wrote back this very <i>provocativo</i> message: "Even better. Twins!"</p><p>Yes&#x2014;much better. Tall, dark and handsome identical twenty-five-year-old twins, as it turned out, with those giant brown liquid-center Italian eyes that just unstitch me. After meeting the boys in person, I began to wonder if perhaps I should adjust my rule somewhat about remaining celibate this year. For instance, perhaps I could remain totally celibate <i>except</i> for keeping a pair of handsome twenty-five-year-old Italian twin brothers as lovers. Which was slightly reminiscent of a friend of mine who is vegetarian except for bacon, but nonetheless ... I was already composing my letter to <i>Penthouse</i>:</p><p><i>In the flickering, candlelit shadows of the Roman caf�, it was impossible to tell whose hands were caress</i>&#x2014;</p><p>But, no.</p><p>No and no.</p><p>I chopped tvhe fantasy off in mid-word. This was not my moment to be seeking romance and (as day follows night) to further complicate my already knotty life. This was my moment to look for the kind of healing and peace that can only come from solitude.</p><p>Anyway, by now, by the middle of November, the shy, studious Giovanni and I have become dear buddies. As for Dario&#x2014;the more razzle-dazzle swinger brother of the two&#x2014;I have introduced him to my adorable little Swedish friend Sofie, and how they've been sharing <i>their</i> evenings in Rome is another kind of Tandem Exchange altogether. But Giovanni and I, we only talk. Well, we eat and we talk. We have been eating and talking for many pleasant weeks now, sharing pizzas and gentle grammatical corrections, and tonight has been no exception. A lovely evening of new idioms and fresh mozzarella.</p><p>Now it is midnight and foggy, and Giovanni is walking me home to my apartment through these back streets of Rome, which meander organically around the ancient buildings like bayou streams snaking around shadowy clumps of cypress groves. Now we are at my door. We face each other. He gives me a warm hug. This is an improvement; for the first few weeks, he would only shake my hand. I think if I were to stay in Italy for another three years, he might actually get up the juice to kiss me. On the other hand, he might just kiss me right now, tonight, right here by my door ... there's still a chance ... I mean we're pressed up against each other's bodies beneath this moonlight ... and of course it would be a <i>terrible</i> mistake ... but it's still such a wonderful possibility that he might actually do it right now ... that he might just bend down ... and ... and ... Nope.</p><p>He separates himself from the embrace.</p><p>"Good night, my dear Liz," he says.</p><p>"<i>Buona notte, caro mio</i>," I reply.</p><p>I walk up the stairs to my fourth-floor apartment, all alone. I let myself into my tiny little studio, all alone. I shut the door behind me. Another solitary bedtime in Rome. Another long night's sleep ahead of me, with nobody and nothing in my bed except a pile of Italian phrasebooks and dictionaries.</p><p>I am alone, I am all alone, I am completely alone.</p><p>Grasping this reality, I let go of my bag, drop to my knees and press my forehead against the floor. There, I offer up to the universe a fervent prayer of thanks.</p><p>First in English.</p><p>Then in Italian.</p><p>And then&#x2014;just to get the point across&#x2014;in Sanskrit.<br><br><b>2</b><br><br>And since I am already down there in supplication on the floor, let me hold that position as I reach back in time three years earlier to the moment when this entire story began&#x2014;a moment which also found me in this exact same posture: on my knees, on a floor, praying.</p><p>Everything else about the three-years-ago scene was different, though. That time, I was not in Rome but in the upstairs bathroom of the big house in the suburbs of New York which I'd recently purchased with my husband. It was a cold November, around three o'clock in the morning. My husband was sleeping in our bed. I was hiding in the bathroom for something like the forty-seventh consecutive night, and&#x2014;just as during all those nights before&#x2014;I was sobbing. Sobbing so hard, in fact, that a great lake of tears and snot was spreading before me on the bathroom tiles, a veritable Lake Inferior (if you will) of all my shame and fear and confusion and grief.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore</i>.</p><p>I was trying so hard not to know this, but the truth kept insisting itself to me.</p><p><i>I don't want to be married anymore. I don't want to live in this big house. I don't want to have a baby</i>.</p><p>But I was supposed to want to have a baby. I was thirty-one years old. My husband and I&#x2014;who had been together for eight years, married for six&#x2014;had built our entire life around the common expectation that, after passing the doddering old age of thirty, I would want to settle down and have children. By then, we mutually anticipated, I would have grown weary of traveling and would be happy to live in a big, busy household full of children and homemade quilts, with a garden in the backyard and a cozy stew bubbling on the stovetop. (The fact that this was a fairly accurate portrait of my own mother is a quick indicator of how difficult it once was for me to tell the difference between myself and the powerful woman who had raised me.) But I didn't&#x2014;as I was appalled to be finding out&#x2014;want any of these things. Instead, as my twenties had come to a close, that deadline of THIRTY had loomed over me like a death sentence, and I discovered that I did not want to be pregnant. I kept waiting to want to have a baby, but it didnt happen. And I know what it feels like to want something, believe me. I well know what desire feels like. But it wasn't there. Moreover, I couldn't stop thinking about what my sister had said to me once, as she was breast-feeding her firstborn: 'Having a baby is like getting a tattoo on your face. You really need to be certain it's what you want before you commit.'</p><p>How could I turn back now, though? Everything was in place. This was supposed to be the year. In fact, we'd been trying to get pregnant for a few months already. But nothing had happened (aside from the fact that&#x2014;in an almost sarcastic mockery of pregnancy&#x2014;I was experiencing psychosomatic morning sickness, nervously throwing up my breakfast every day). And every month when I got my period I would find myself whispering furtively in the bathroom: <i>Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you for giving me one more month to live</i> ... </p><p> </p><p></p></p><h2>The Madness Underneath: Book 2 (The Shades of London)</h2><p><b>Don't miss this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling sequel to the Edgar Award-nominated <i>THE NAME OF THE STAR</i>!</b><br><br>After her near-fatal run-in with the Jack the Ripper copycat, Rory Devereaux has been living in Bristol under the close watch of her parents.

The situation will only get worse if you explain to your therapist that you have friends in the secret ghost police of London, and that you are really not supposed to be talking about this because some man from the government made you sign a copy of the Official Secrets Act and promise never to talk about these ghost police friends of yours. No. That won&#x2019;t improve your situation at all.

I had no idea what to do with myself, now that I was actually out of the house. I saw a coffee place. That&#x2019;s where I would go. I&#x2019;d get a coffee, and then I&#x2019;d walk home. That was a good, normal thing to do. I would do this, and then maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe I would do another thing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Funny thing when you don&#x2019;t get out of the house for a while&#x2014;you reenter the outside world as a tourist. I stared at the people working on laptops, studying, writing things down in notebooks. I flirted with the idea of telling the guy who was making my latte, just blurting it out: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m the girl the Ripper attacked.&#x201d; And I could whip up my shirt and show him the still-healing wound. You couldn&#x2019;t fake the thing I had stretching across my torso&#x2014;the long, angry line. Well, I guess you <i>could, </i>but you&#x2019;d have to be one of those special-effects makeup people to do it. Also, people who get up to the coffee counter and whip off their shirts for the baristas usually have other problems.<br>&nbsp;<br>I took my coffee and left quickly before I got any other funny little ideas.<br>&nbsp;<br>God, I needed to talk to someone.<br>&nbsp;<br>I don&#x2019;t know about you, but when something happens to me&#x2014;good, bad, boring, it doesn&#x2019;t matter&#x2014;I have to <i>tell</i> someone about it to make it count. There&#x2019;s no point in anything happening if you can&#x2019;t talk about it. And this was the biggest something of all. I <i>ached</i> to talk. I mean, it literally hurt me, sitting there, holding it all in hour after hour. I must have been clenching my stomach muscles the whole time, because my whole abdomen throbbed. Sometimes, if I was still awake late at night, I&#x2019;d be tempted to call some anonymous crisis hotline and tell some random person my story, but I knew what would happen. They&#x2019;d listen, and they&#x2019;d advise me to get psychiatric help. Because my story was nuts.<br>&nbsp;<br>The &#x201c;official&#x201d; story:<br>&nbsp;<br>A man decides to terrorize London by re-creating the murders of Jack the Ripper. He kills four people, one of them, unluckily, on the green right in front of my building at school. I see this guy when sneaking back into my building that night. Because I&#x2019;m a witness, he decides to target me for the last murder. He sneaks into my building on the night of the final Ripper murder and stabs me. I survive because the police get a report of a sighting of something suspicious and break into the building. The suspect flees, the police chase him, and he jumps into the Thames and dies.<br>&nbsp;<br>The real version:<br>&nbsp;<br>The Ripper was the ghost of a man formerly of the ghost policing squad. He targeted me because I could see ghosts. His whole aim was to get his hands on a terminus, the tool the ghost police use to destroy ghosts. The termini (there were actually three of them) were diamonds. When you ran an electrical current through them, they destroyed ghosts. Stephen had wired them into the hollow bodies of cell phones, using the batteries to power the charge. I survived that night because Jo, another ghost, grabbed a terminus out of my hand and destroyed the Ripper&#x2014;and in the process, herself.<br>&nbsp;<br>The only people who really knew the whole story were Stephen, Callum, and Boo, and I was never allowed to talk to them again. That was one of the conditions when I left London. A man from the government really had made me sign the Official Secrets Act. Measures had been taken to make sure I couldn&#x2019;t reach out to them. While I was in the hospital after the attack, knocked out cold, someone took my phone and wiped it clean.<br>&nbsp;<br>Keep quiet, they said.<br>&nbsp;<br>Just get on with your life, they said.<br>&nbsp;<br>So I was here, in Bristol, sitting around in the rented house that my parents lived in. It was a nice enough little house, high up on a rise, with a good view of the city. It had rental house furnishings, straight out of a catalog. White walls and neutral colors. A non-place, good for recuperating. No ghosts. No explosions. Just television and rain and lots of sleep and screwing around on the Internet. My life went nowhere here, and that was fine. I&#x2019;d had enough excitement. I just had to try to forget, to embrace the boredom, to let it go.<br>&nbsp;<br>I walked along the waterside. The mist dropped layer upon delicate layer of moisture into my clothes and hair, slowly chilling me and weighing me down. Nothing to do but walk today. I would walk and walk. Maybe I would walk right down the river into another town. Maybe I would walk all the way to the ocean. Maybe I would swim home.<br>&nbsp;<br>I was so preoccupied in my wallowing that I almost walked right past him, but something about the suit must have caught my attention. The cut of the suit&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. something was strange about it. I&#x2019;m not an expert on suits, but this one was somehow different, a very drab gray with a narrow lapel. And the collar. The collar was odd. He wore horn-rim glasses, and his hair was very short, but with square sideburns. Everything was just a centimeter or two off, all the little data points that tell you someone isn&#x2019;t quite right. <br>&nbsp;<br>He was a ghost.<br>&nbsp;<br>My ability to see ghosts, my &#x201c;sight,&#x201d; was the result of two elements: I had the innate ability, and I&#x2019;d had a brush with death at the right time. It was not magic. It was not supernatural. It was, as Stephen liked to put it, the &#x201c;ability to recognize and interact with the vestigial energy of an otherwise deceased person, one who continues to exist in a spectrum usually not perceived by humans.&#x201d; Stephen actually talked like that.<br>&nbsp;<br>What it meant was simply this: some people, when they die, don&#x2019;t entirely <i>eject</i> from this world. Something goes wrong in the death process, like when you try to shut down a computer and it goes into a confused spiral. These unlucky people remain on some plane of existence that intersects with the one we inhabit. Most of them are weak, barely able to interact with our physical world. Some are a bit stronger. And lucky people like me can see them, and talk to them, and touch them.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is why in my many, many hours of watching shows about ghost hunters (I&#x2019;d watched a <i>lot</i> of television in Bristol) I&#x2019;d gotten so angry. Not only were the shows stupid and obviously phony, but they didn&#x2019;t even make sense. These people would rock up to houses with their weird night-vision camera hats and cold-spot-o-meters, set up cameras, and then turn off all the lights and wait until dark. (Because apparently ghosts care if the lights are on or off and if it&#x2019;s day or night.) And then, these champions would fumble around in the dark, saying, &#x201c;IF SPIRITS ARE HERE, MAKE YOURSELVES KNOWN, SPIRITS.&#x201d; This is roughly equivalent to a tourist bus stopping in the middle of a foreign city and all of the tourists getting out in their funny hats with their video cameras and saying, &#x201c;We are here! Dance for us, natives of this place! We wish to film you!&#x201d; And, of course, nothing happens. Then there&#x2019;s always a bump in the background, some normal creaking of a step or something, and they amplify that about ten million times, claim they&#x2019;ve found evidence of paranormal activity, and kick off for a cold, self-congratulatory brew.<br>&nbsp;<br>I edged around for a few minutes, taking him in from a few different angles, making sure I knew what I was looking at. I wondered what the chances were that the first time I came out and walked around Bristol on my own, I&#x2019;d see a ghost. Judging from what was going on right now, those chances were very good. A hundred percent, in fact. It made a kind of sense that I&#x2019;d find one here. I was walking along a river and, as Stephen had explained to me once, waterways always have a long history of death. Ships sink and people jump into rivers. Rivers and ghosts go together.<br>&nbsp;<br>I crossed in front of him, pretending to talk on my phone. He had a blank stare on his face, the stare of someone who truly had nothing to do but just <i>exist.</i> I stared right at him. Most people, when stared at, stare back. Because staring is weird. But ghosts are used to people looking right through them. As I suspected, he didn&#x2019;t react in any way to my staring. There was a grayness, a loneliness about him that was palpable. Unseen, unheard, unloved. He was still existing, but for no reason.<br>&nbsp;<br>Definitely a ghost.<br>&nbsp;<br>It occurred to me, he could have a friend. He could have someone to share this existence with. Something welled up in me, a great feeling of warmth, of generosity, a swelling of the spirit. I could share something with him, and in return, he could help me as well. Whoever this guy was, <i>I</i> <i>could tell him the truth.</i> He was part of the truth. No, he didn&#x2019;t know me, but that hardly mattered. He was <i>about</i> to get to know me. We would be friends. Oh, yes. We would be friends. We were <i>meant</i> to be together. For the first time in weeks, there was a path&#x2014;a logical, clear, walkable path. And it started with me sitting on the bench.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said.<br>&nbsp;<br>He didn&#x2019;t turn.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said again. &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m talking to you. On the bench. Here. With me. Can you hear me?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>He turned to look at me, his eyes wide in surprise.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Bet you&#x2019;re surprised,&#x201d; I said, smiling. &#x201c;I know. It&#x2019;s weird. But I can see you. My name&#x2019;s Rory. What&#x2019;s yours?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>No answer. Just a wide, eternal stare. <br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m new here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;To Bristol. I was in London. I&#x2019;m from America, but I guess you can tell that from my accent? I came here to go to school, and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The man bolted from his seat. Ghosts have a fluidity of movement that the living don&#x2019;t know&#x2014;they remain solid, yet they can move like air. I didn&#x2019;t want him to go, so I bounced up and reached as far as I could to catch his coat. The second I made contact, I felt my fingers getting pulled into his body, like I had put them into the suction end of a vacuum. I felt the ripple of energy going up my arm, the inexorable force linking us both together now, then the rush of air, far greater than any waterside breeze. Then came the flash of light and the unsettling, floral smell.<br>&nbsp;<br>And he was gone.</p><h2>The Twelve Stories of Christmas</h2><p>Author Joe Wheeler is now known to many holiday readers-and his ardent and loyal fans-as &#34;Father Christmas.&#34; Dr. Wheeler is content to be &#34;one who loves old-timey stories-not just any stories, but the ones that tug at your heartstrings and make you cry.&#34; Now for the first time, all of his original Christmas stories are available in one beautifully decorated volume.

Author Gunther E. Rothenberg describes how Napoleon transformed interstate warfare into a system of relentless conquest, creating a military superpower on a scale not seen since the Roman Empire. Though eventually defeated, Napoleon's model of conquest set a pattern that was to be revived by modern totalitarian states, and their opponents.</p><ul><li>A sweeping examination of the rise, triumph, and eventual downfall of Napoleon, a man whose military genius forever changed the face of war.</li><li>Analysis of Napoleon's system of waging war, and the strategies that allowed him to create a singularly powerful army. </li><li>A look at the profound influence of Napoleonic conquest on warfare of the modern era.</li></ul></p><p>Military historian Gunther Rothenberg provides a detailed account of the Napoleonic Wars in this installment of Cassell's multivolume series covering the history of warfare. The treatment is predominantly military rather than social. The matter-of-fact, dispassionate text is rich in tactical details and statistics, augmented by contemporary paintings, well-designed maps, and diagrams. The actions of the protagonists' commanders are also critically assessed, with much attention given to Napoleon himself, stressing the power of his charisma but showing that his insistence on sole control ultimately proved a weakness. Significantly, <i>The Napoleonic Wars</i> aims to show that, far from being the end of a military era, this was a period marking the origins of modern warfare. Developments in army organization, strategy, and weaponry gained from the experience of over 20 years of war are progressively described. The main points of Rothenberg's argument, that Napoleonic strategies continued to be followed and that the sheer scale of war was revolutionary, are summed up in the brief epilogue. The bulk of the broadly chronological text is uncluttered by too much speculation; military-history buffs will appreciate <i>The Napoleonic Wars</i> for its clarity. <i>--Karen Tiley, Amazon.co.uk</i>Gunther Rothenberg was the world&#39;s leading authority on the Napoleonic Wars. He served with the British, Israeli and US Military and was Professor of History at Purdue University in the USA. He was the leading English-speaking historian of warfare in the German-speaking lands.

Johnston <p>A wide-ranging and penetrating look at one of the greatest sculptors of the nineteenth century. </p><p>Antoine-Louis Barye&#x2019;s animal sculptures are celebrated as much for their technical brilliance and painstaking detail as for their uncanny resemblance to their subjects. Principally known as an animal sculptor, he was also a consummate modeler of the human form. This volume gathers Barye&#x2019;s works from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, whose collection of the artist&#x2019;s work is second only to that of the Louvre. In addition to the artist&#x2019;s magnificent and anatomically accurate sculptures, the book also features his often-overlooked paintings and drawings. A critical examination of his techniques draws on recent conservation work, and thoughtful assessments of the critical debates surrounding his work provide new insights for scholars and enthusiasts of nineteenth-century sculpture. </p><p>William R.

Zama lives in South London with his wife and two sons.A thriving arranged-marriage bureau in contemporary India resides at the heart of Zama's charming debut. The customers who visit Mr. Ali's bureau&#x2014;a project he began in retirement to pass the time&#x2014;are mostly pragmatists: they look for mates based on height, complexion, caste, economic status and religion. As business picks up, Mr. Ali, a Muslim, takes on a young assistant, Aruna, a poor Hindu girl, who helps him formulate happy unions. While the bureau prospers, Mr. Ali and his wife contend with their headstrong son, a human rights advocate who worries them constantly, and Aruna faces her dismal home life and a handsome young client who may want more from her than lists of potential matches. Zama's strength is in showing the love that makes the matchmaking system possible, looking at the reciprocity, trust and devotion that underlie marriage. Though the dialogue can tend toward the wooden and some problems work out too tidily, Zama's delightful world of mid-morning tea breaks, afternoon siestas, picnics in mango groves and meddlesome aunties is a pleasant place to hang out. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Which favorite presuppositions are unfounded, which statistically biased? By conjoining two opposing mindsets--the suspension of disbelief required in storytelling and the skepticism inherent in the scientific method--bestselling mathematician John Allen Paulos has created an unusual hybrid, a composite of personal memories and mathematical approaches to re-evaluating them.Entertaining vignettes from Paulos&#39;s biography abound--ranging from a bullying math teacher and a fabulous collection of baseball cards to romantic crushes, a grandmother&#39;s petty larceny, and his quite unintended role in getting George Bush elected president in 2000. These vignettes serve as springboards to many telling perspectives: simple arithmetic puts life-long habits in a dubious new light; higher dimensional geometry helps us see that we&#39;re all rather peculiar; nonlinear dynamics explains the narcissism of small differences cascading into very different siblings; logarithms and exponentials yield insight on why we tend to become bored and jaded as we age; and there are tricks and jokes, probability and coincidences, and much more.For fans of Paulos or newcomers to his work, this witty commentary on his life--and yours--is fascinating reading.</p><p><b>John Allen Paulos</b> is a professor of mathematics at Temple University and the author of eight previous books, including the best-selling <i>Innumeracy</i> and<i>&nbsp;A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper</i>."There's nothing more enlightening than a view of life's nuances as seen through the lens of a mathematician. &nbsp;Especially when that mathematician is John Allen Paulos, a brilliant educator who persistently empowers the reader to think in ways that render transparent much of what is opaque in the world around us."<br><br>&#x2015;NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON, Astrophysicist, American Museum of Natural History<br><br>&#x201c;<i>A Numerate Life</i> is the engaging history of a mathematical mind.

A Friday morning in spring, a sea fret receding to Storm Bay and the Tasman Sea, it was good to be alive, and she attracted no attention in her tennis whites worn over tracksuit pants, sunglasses, Nike trainers and perky billed cap. A racquet handle poked out of her gym bag, telling you she was an idle young wife, maybe a young professional on her day off, even&#x2014;if you were the suspicious type&#x2014;an adulterer wearing a cover story.<br> But no warning bells. No cause for a stop-and-search. She belonged there.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In fact, it was hide in plain sight, Grace hiding behind the cap and shades, hiding the fact that the tennis skirt was Velcroed to the bodice and the gym bag held burglary tools, gloves and heavy-duty vinyl sacks. One shouted accusation, one query, and she&#x2019;d be gone. &nbsp;Rip away the skirt, ditch it together with the cap, bag and shades and she&#x2019;d be transformed into a jogger, and who looks twice at a jogger?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Always expect the worst,&#x2019; Galt had drummed into her, &#x2018;and you&#x2019;ll never be caught off guard.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Another thing Galt told her was to avoid apartment buildings. Well, there were none here. There&#x2019;s always someone at home in an apartment block, Galt said, always a sad soul sitting at a window all day long, hoping for a diversion to brighten the unvarying hours.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next, Grace checked for children: toys, bikes, skateboards, even a little pink gumboot, discarded in a front yard. Yes, kids go to school, Galt would say; but not if they&#x2019;re a toddler or they&#x2019;ve got the chickenpox, not if it&#x2019;s a curriculum day for their teachers. And a kid at home means an adult at home.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Vehicles were on Galt&#x2019;s checklist too. Grace knew she was in a land of two-car households, two adults working 9 to 5 in highly paid jobs. No shift workers here. Play it safe, Galt always said. If there&#x2019;s a vehicle in the driveway, the carport, move on. Or a closed garage door. Doesn&#x2019;t mean the garage is empty.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, choose your targets to minimise the nosy-neighbour problem. The people worth stealing from paid top dollar to block an outsider&#x2019;s line of sight, Galt said. She should look for high hedges, sloping land, tree density and curved streets.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The rest Galt hadn&#x2019;t taught her. &#x2018;I can show you how to stay under the radar&#x2019; he&#x2019;d said. &#x2018;I can keep my people off your back, but you were the break-in queen long before I found you.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grace made a rapid pass through the little neighbourhood. Trees and bushes crowded most of the houses. No one about, only a workman bolting a gate to a picket fence, another rolling a lawnmower off a ute. The houses ranged from weatherboard bungalows to sharply modern glass and concrete structures, with Tudor houses, Tuscan villas and small, tiled, steeply-gabled 1930s mansions in between. She mentally selected four targets and went to work.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first was a nightmarish arrangement of interconnected concrete cubes, set well back from the street behind a high fieldstone wall. She entered the grounds briskly, as she always did, as if her best friend lived there and they&#x2019;d arranged to play tennis. When she was halfway to the front door she blew a high-frequency whistle, the kind audible only to dogs. She was answered at once by frenzied barking, one deep-chested, the other a high yap.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She retreated.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In the next street was a low 1970s ranch house set among gumtrees. No dogs. She made a quick circuit of the building, testing knobs and handles and peering through windows. Occasionally she found unlocked doors and windows, fake alarm boxes or no security at all, but often those places had nothing worth stealing. Grace went around the house again, this time running a small camping compass around the door and window frames. The compass needle dipped to indicate a live current at all but the front door. People had a misplaced faith in the security of their front doors, perhaps because most front doors face the street. Grace tested it again. A slight deflection of the needle near the latch.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was a glass door, comprising a single pane secured around the edges by narrow wooden beadings. Grace fished a metal bar from the gym bag and prised away the beadings, stacking the strips neatly beside her, until the whole pane was revealed. Then she removed it using a pair of glazier&#x2019;s suction caps and propped it against the wall beside the entryway.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She slipped into the house, and into the smell of money. The building itself was ugly, a throwback, but the interior was starkly modern, with polished floorboards, minimalist glass and leather, a pair of Brett Whiteley bird drawings on one wall. The Whiteleys might bring a few grand, but their size ruled them out. &nbsp;She photographed them in case she wanted to come back for them, in a year or so, when the owners had recovered from their shock and dismay. Meanwhile she&#x2019;d show the images to Finch, see if he knew a potential buyer. She also snapped a pair of Fuzan Satsuma vases. Turn of the last century, she thought. Worth about $5,000. A few hundred bucks from Finch, but they were too big to go in the gym bag without risk of damage.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;After a quick assessment of the house, Grace settled on the main bedroom and the study. The starkness was modified here by everyday clutter: in the bedroom a cracked-spine paperback, a foil strip of painkillers, an errant sock; in the study a couple of chewed ballpoint pens, an in-tray stacked with invoices and letters, a set of golf clubs, and a water pistol. It all said something about home life, family life, neither of which interested Grace. She began to tug open the drawers.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She was out of the house within five minutes. In the bag were a pair of emerald earrings, a Bulova watch, an iPod Classic, a Toshiba laptop and some unused AutoCAD software, still in the box. The software alone was $6,000 new, the computer $3,000.<br> In the next street was a plain weatherboard cottage with a modern extension at the rear, vast and airy. No dogs, another easy front door, but at the last moment she saw a cornice-mounted red light blinking through a gap in the sitting-room curtain. She checked another room: another red light. She had no intention of going in against motion detectors. She moved on to the fourth and last target on her list, a pretty loft house with a steeply pitched roof and cathedral ceilings. Again, dog-free. No motion detectors that she could see, and a front door that was alarmed only at the latch. Every part of the door was wooden: an outer frame, a cross member, and plywood panel inserts secured by thin beadings. She decided to remove the bottom panel and crawl through.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;But first, a diversion. She took a pair of shoes, size eleven, from her bag, slipped them over her runners and went over to crouch in the loamy soil against the side wall. Something to occupy the detectives who would be called to investigate.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then she went to work. Prise away the beadings, fasten two eyehooks to the panel, wiped clean and sprayed with bleach to screw with her DNA. When the fumes cleared she jerked the panel out of its seating and put it aside.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She crawled in. Her hip caught in the narrow opening, snagging a tiny white thread. She always incinerated her outfits after a job&#x2014;clothing, gloves, footwear&#x2014;but she paused to remove it anyway. Why give the cops a chance to add &#x2018;possibly wears tennis whites&#x2019; to her profile?<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;This house was fussy and careworn. The carpeting was expensive but the pattern varied from room to room and never quite matched the walls or curtains. There were too many knickknacks: porcelain shepherd girls, nests of wooden bowls, glass paperweights threaded with colour, family photographs in heavy silver frames (plate, she noticed), and someone liked elephants. Herds of them&#x2014;wood, glass, papier-m�ch�&#x2014;trampled and trumpeted along window ledges and corner tables.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;But there was a little Sydney Long aquatint on one wall, possibly a family heirloom. Grace removed it from its ugly frame, rolled it into a narrow tube and slid it into a hollowed-out racquet handle.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She checked all of the rooms and settled on some easy-to-move electronics&#x2014;a portable hard drive, a video camera, and the prize, a top-flight Canon digital SLR worth over ten grand.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grace strolled back to the pub on the corner and then down the hill to her rental car, parked outside a gym beside the water. No one stopped her and if they looked, it was at the arrogant way she loped along. All the young women loped here. They felt entitled. Grace liked messing with that.<br><br> Chapter 2<br> &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grace used a restroom at Hobart airport to reinvent herself as an executive in a hurry: pantyhose, heels, black jacket, narrow skirt and a briefcase. If you were an airport official, you wouldn&#x2019;t tangle with her.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;By late morning she was on the mainland, changing clothes again, dressing down this time: loose jeans, grubby trainers, stretched cotton hoodie. Then she collected her Golf from the long-term car park and headed along the Tullamarine Freeway towards the centre of Melbourne, knowing it would be hours yet before her break-ins were noticed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Golf hummed. She&#x2019;d thought long and hard about her choice of car. All of her rules were simple. &nbsp;&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t get caught,&#x2019; obviously, &#x2018;know when to walk away from a job,&#x2019; and &#x2018;have a fallback position.&#x2019; But a central one was &#x2018;never work close to home.&#x2019; She always operated outside of the state. Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, the Gold Coast, Noosa, Launceston, Hobart...Wherever the money was. Never in New South Wales. The wrong people knew her there. Galt people. Interstate then, and sometimes she drove to and from a job. Long distances, so comfort was important. If she ever had to run, she wanted plenty of torque and power. Plenty of safety features, in case she rolled or pranged. Good handling on hairy corners and switchback roads.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hence the Golf. A Porsche, Audi, BMW or Alfa would have been nice, but noticeable. No one would look twice at a Falcon, Holden or Camry, but they were salesmen&#x2019;s cars, they handled like boats, and Grace needed a convincing cover story ready to explain what she was doing on a major interstate in the middle of the night. And so she drove a 2-litre diesel Golf, a young woman&#x2019;s car, perfect for a cute young contracts lawyer with a fear of flying. No self-respecting drug courier or jewel thief would drive one; no highway cop would get an itch to chase one.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Of course, it made sense to fly sometimes. Imagine being subjected to a spot search on a car ferry with a boot-load of gear...<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Today she had a clear run on the toll road between Melbourne airport and the city, and again when she headed south over the West Gate Bridge, high winds buffeting the little car, and down into Williamstown, where the mean grind of old Melbourne co-existed with bright young mortgages. Factories and workshops sat next to pastelly little townhouses with cute, candy-coloured cars in the driveways. Grace wound down her window. The air, dense and still, was faintly salted from the Bay. The trees, branches barely moving, seemed dazed from the years-long drought.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She parked in a cramped yard behind a corner pub. She&#x2019;d dressed down at the airport, and now her demeanour was down, too, a little defeated-looking as she trudged with a plastic shopping bag down the block to Steve Finch&#x2019;s second-hand shop. Leaning on his display window as if to remove a stone from her shoe, she scanned the area for stakeout vans, cameras behind curtains or cops inside the shop. Nothing. She went in. If the cops came now, she was just a punter with a few bits of rubbish to pawn.<br> Nothing ever changed in Finch&#x2019;s shop. Open seven days a week, dusty TV sets and VCRs in the window, boxy computer monitors on card tables, cartons of vinyl records, cassette tapes and paperback books. Islands of unloved and unlovely furniture to negotiate before she found Steve at an ink-stained counter, working the keyboard of a sleek new Mac. He reeked of aftershave. It fought the mustiness and won.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Be with you in a minute.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;He hadn&#x2019;t looked up; wouldn&#x2019;t have heard her above the radio, set to a thrash station and marked down to $15. But he would have seen her on the security monitors. Cameras covered all the corners and overlooked the street, side paths and back yard. In fact, Grace had advised him what to install where.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hadn&#x2019;t looked up, and hadn&#x2019;t used body language to warn her either, meaning there were no cops behind a wardrobe or lurking in his office.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;She studied him. Finch&#x2019;s face was crammed with large features slapped onto a narrow skull, nose and chin hooking forward, ears like sails. He wore his hair long as if to bulk up the narrowness. He was about forty, tall, well-dressed in a cotton shirt and trousers. His grimy fingers were probably from tinkering inside the guts of the turntable lying in pieces beside the computer.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Needs a new motor and rollers,&#x2019; he said, reading her mind. Still not looking at her.<br> He tapped a few more keys and peered at the screen. &#x2018;Place in California can ship them to me.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Worth it?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Now he looked at her. &#x2018;Is it worth it? Collector&#x2019;s item, Suze.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Susan was as good a name as Grace, or any of the others she used. She also had passports, credit cards and driver&#x2019;s licences in names she hadn&#x2019;t used yet, names of babies that had died around the time she was born. And there was an old name, Nina, lurking in her dreams that seemed real where the others didn&#x2019;t. But just now, with Steve Finch, she was Suze, short for Susan.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;He grinned at her as a thought entered his head and raised one finger. &#x2018;Something to show you.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;A photograph of his baby son, the child clutching a chair and looking outraged. &#x2018;Took his first steps about ten seconds later,&#x2019; Finch said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;How gorgeous,&#x2019; Grace said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The new young wife, the pregnancy, the maternity ward and now the first footsteps, recorded in photographs that Steve insisted on showing her whenever she came to do business.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;How&#x2019;s <i>your</i> little one?&#x2019; he said now. &#x2018;Any new photos?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Steven Finch, dealer in stolen property and sentimental family man,&#x2019; said Grace, opening her wallet to a series of small photographs in clear plastic sleeves, the first a toothy blonde three-year-old.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Finch grabbed the wallet and peered. &#x2018;Cute,&#x2019; he said, then flipping through.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x2018;Awww, look at her in her tutu.&#x2019; He peered again, read aloud&#x2014;&#x2018;Hurstbridge Community Childcare Centre&#x2019;&#x2014;and glanced worriedly at Grace. &#x2018;Your sister&#x2019;s out there, right?&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Grace let pain show fleetingly, evidence of an old heartache, a heroin habit to feed, trying to get back on track but you know how it is. She swallowed, coughed, and managed to say, &#x2018;I see her whenever I can.&#x2019;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Steve nodded, still doubtful....</p><h2>Field of Blood (Paddy Meehan, Book 1) (Paddy Meehan, 1)</h2><p><b>Set in Glasgow in 1981, a time of hunger strikes, riots and unemployment that decimated the old industrial heartlands, <i>The Field of Blood</i> is the first in the tense Paddy Meehan series from Scotland's princess of crime, Denise Mina.</b><br>The vicious murder of a young child provides rookie journalist Paddy Meehan with her first big break when the suspect turns out to be her fiance's 11-year old cousin.

She lives in Glasgow.Starred Review. If this novel were a movie, filmgoers would tag it the one to beat for the Oscars. Beyond creating sweaty physical tension, the brilliant Mina may have invented a subgenre: moral suspense. Patricia "Paddy" Meehan, a copygirl at Glasgow's <i>Daily News</i>, has struggled with issues of goodness since childhood. "I knew I was lying when I made my first communion," she confesses to fianc� Sean Ogilvy the night she delivers other shockers. She won't marry him. And she wants his help interviewing his 10-year-old cousin, Callum, who's been charged with murdering a toddler. Scots are deemed legally responsible at eight, but Paddy sees Callum as another victim. Paddy, who shares a nickname with a career criminal wrongfully imprisoned for murder, can't tolerate injustice. At the heart of the plot is her decision pose as colleague Heather Allen when she makes dangerous inquiries, a choice that spells death for the real Heather, who's everything Paddy isn't: slim blonde whistle bait&#x2014;and ambitious enough to steal a story from Paddy. After Heather's murder, the reader writhes, not just because Paddy's in danger but because a moment of awful truth awaits her. Mina spins the complexities in the rough music of her working-class Scots, unsparing of brutal details, but unfailingly elegant in her humanity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed had won over fear.</p> <p>Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand, the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to open his wings. The beetle's legs waved in protest as the sharp claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him from over the scorpion's head and immediately he was dead.</p> <p>After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for nearly five minutes. During this time it identified the nature of its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations. Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the beetle's flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness, the scorpion ate its victim.</p> <p>The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could be picked out from many miles away.</p> <p>The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the British Commonwealth.</p> <p>An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations. First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle's movements, and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion immediately recognised and diagnosed. Then there had been a series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion's hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the ground which was so regular that it soon became a background vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got the upper hand against the scorpion's memory of the other noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p> <p>And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion's own death sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the range of the scorpion's sensory system.</p> <p>And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock. There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p> <p>The heavy stone came down.</p> <p>'Black bastard.'</p> <p>The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death agony.</p> <p>The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head, scrambled out into the open.</p> <p>The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for, and which had signed the scorpion's death warrant, was louder. As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling rotor blades.</p> <p>The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes. From one of these he extracted a small heavy package which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with them to where, fifty yards from the big horns bush, there was a clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner and waited.</p> <p>The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades idling. It looked like a huge, badly constructed insect. To the man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much noise.</p> <p>The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p> <p>The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p> <p>In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup of a nightbird.</p> <p>After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine while the other man walked round the four corners of the landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at the prospect of listening to the other man's inevitable complaint. He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly, stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back again.</p> <p>As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in greeting. 'Everything all right?'</p> <p>'I hope so. But you're late again. I shall only just make it through the frontier by first light.'</p> <p>'Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God there are only thirteen full moons a year.

It was damp with the sweat from the smuggler's ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his trim bush shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p> <p>'Good,' he said. He turned towards his machine.</p> <p>'Just a moment,' said the diamond smuggler. There was a sullen note in his voice.</p> <p>The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it's the voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain about his food. 'Ja. What is it?'</p> <p>'Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don't like it at all. There's been a big intelligence man down from London. You've read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he's been hired by the Diamond Corporation. There've been a lot of new regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It's frightened out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well, one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened things up a bit. But I've had to pay more. An extra ten per cent. And they're still not satisfied. One of these days those security people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know these black swine. They can't stand a real beating.' He looked swiftly into the pilot's eyes and then away again. 'For the matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not even me.'</p> <p>'So?' said the pilot. He paused. 'Do you want me to pass this threat back to ABC?'</p> <p>'I'm not threatening anyone,' said the other man hastily.' I just want them to know that it's getting tough. They must know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe. And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a year through smug-gling and IDE and that it was up to the government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means "stop me"!'</p> <p>'And me,' said the pilot mildly. 'So what do you want? More money?'</p> <p>'Yes,' said the other man stubbornly. 'I want a bigger cut.

Born in Romania, he worked in Paris for over fifty years, gaining an international reputation. His achievement in refining figurative elements into near-abstract architypal forms had a huge influence on the development of modern sculpture. This text accompanies the exhibition at Tate Modern, Spring 2004.</p><p>It's hard to imagine a more perfect depiction of love than "The Kiss," Constantin Brancusi's blocky stone sculpture of a nose-to-nose, belly-to-belly couple bound by encircling arms. Brancusi's powerful elemental shapes, carved from stone, wood, and marble, remain touchstones of modern art. But compared to contemporaries like Picasso and Modigliani, the Romania-born artist, who died in 1957, still remains something of an enigma. A slender, attractively designed book, <i>Constantin Brancusi: The essence of things</i> examines the artist's folkloric cultural and artistic heritage, his years in Paris and his revolutionary sculptural language. Along the way, the essayists attempt to refine the standard view of Brancusi as the poster boy for "truth to materials"-&#x2014;the self-reliant peasant who struck a blow for modernism around 1907 by cutting directly into the stone block and responding to its unique qualities. Unfortunately, many of the scholarly adjustments to the legend come across as nitpicking footnotes that don't illuminate the bigger picture. (So what if his father was a small landowner in a poor Romanian village, not a real peasant? Why must we therefore view his self-identification with humble folk as a phony public image?) Yet the book contains key insights into Brancusi's stunning reductions of human and animal form, some from the artist himself. About his large marble "Fish" from 1926-&#x2014;a smooth oval shape with a single facet&#x2014;-he wrote, "When you see a fish . . . you think of its speed, its floating, flashing body seen through water. . . . Well, I've tried to express just that." While a reproduction of "Fish" appears in a small photo alongside the text, quite a few of the works discussed by the essayists are not illustrated at all. Even when Brancusi is supposedly boiled down to his "essence," as in this book, it seems a shame not to grant him a better showing. The 37 full-sized color plates correspond with the contents of an exhibition organized by the Tate Modern in London and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York (where it is on view through September 19, 2004). <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i>Carmen Gim�nez is curator of 20th-century art at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York.

Author Mike Dooley, an interpreter for the Universe, has done exactly that in <i>Notes from the Universe</i>&#x2014;a collection of empowering, invaluable truths that can be read front to back or opened at random.<br><br><b> </b><br> <br>This first book in the <i>Notes from the Universe</i> trilogy teaches its readers to live a life far richer than they had previously thought imaginable.<br> <br>The Universe is here to remind us that <i>we</i> are in control. To have the life you desire, all you have to do is ask. The secret to manifesting change is not focusing on the <i>how</i> but instead, the end result of what you&#x2019;re after&#x2014;the kind of life <i>you</i> want. Then, once you are truly focused, the Universe will conspire on your behalf.<br> <br> Author Mike Dooley has turned over every stone, knocked on every door, and followed every impulse. He has immersed himself in the truths he needed to hear most; these were the kind of lessons he wrote about in his weekly emails. What started in 1998 as a little poem sent out once a week to 38 email addresses has evolved into an inspiring anecdote delivered to over 300,000 subscribers from 169 countries, each receiving a new note from the Universe<i> </i>five days a week. Mike Dooley serves as an interpreter for the Universe.<br> <br> <i>Notes from the Universe</i> begins a three-volume set that is brimful with powerful affirmations that will have you thinking positively, feeling confident, and walking the path to personal success.<br> <br> When readers discover the truths the Universe is unveiling in <i>Notes from the Universe,</i>they will begin living happier, more fulfilling lives.</p><p>If ever there was proof of magic in my life, that I now spend part of every day writing for "the Universe", is it. Not even 4 short years ago, after we closed down the last of the TUT stores and liquidated our remaining inventory, I briefly hit the pavement with my accountant's resume in hand. <p>Fortunately, no one was hiring (at least not me!), and fortunately again, I had enough money from our T-shirt days to coast awhile. Even more fortunately, I still had a thousand or so people looking forward to receiving my "Monday Morning Motivators" via email each week. </p><p>So I decided that as long as I didn't have to work, yet, I'd keep doing the one thing that filled me with the greatest sense of accomplishment and purpose - write. And figure out how to make it pay, later. </p><p>Talk about scary. As the months rolled by, there were plenty of nights I tossed, literally in a sweat, thinking "what am I doing with my life? How did I get here? What went wrong? What if I don't make any money at this? What if I have to sell my home? What if I can't find a job, and no one will buy my home? What if? What if? What if...?" And day after day, week after week, month after month, my reserves dwindled and nothing came in. </p><p>But I knew a trick. I knew that figuring out "the how's", wasn't really my job, it was the Universe's. I also knew to focus on the end result, the kind of life I wanted, and to get busy turning over every stone, knocking on every door, following every impulse, so that theoretically, at least, the Universe could take care of the details. </p><p>Whaaaaa! Has it ever!!! Somehow, during all the knocking and turning and visualizing, I acted on enough hunches and instincts to keep me buoyed with the necessary optimism to press on and not look back. And literally, the next thing I knew, the Adventurers Club was born, a variety of speaking opportunities arose, I produced a major audio program that now sells all over the world, and the Universe began using email. Even today, I look around and can hardly believe the reversal and rise of my good fortune. </p><p>I always knew it worked, but the thrill of experiencing it yet again, in spite of my worries, doubts, and frustrations, has been an awesome adventure; one I know everyone deserves and can experience for themselves. </p><p>I've learned, once again, that no matter how dark things get, no matter how difficult, if I continue to do my part, the Universe has to do its part - it's the law, and things will turn around. </p><p>To the life of your dreams, </p><p>Mike Dooley <br>Publisher/Author</p>Courageous is the soul who adventures into time and space to learn of their divinity. For while they cannot lose, they can think they have, and the loss will seem intolerable. And while they cannot fail, they can think they have, and the pain will seem unbearable. And while they cannot ever be less than they truly are - powerful, eternal and loved - they can think they are, and all hope will seem lost. <p>And therein lies their test. A test of percep�tions; of what to focus on, of what to believe in, in spite of appearances. </p><p>Courageous indeed... the pride of the Universe, and I should know.</p></p><h2>Cup of Blood: A Crispin Guest Medieval Noir Prequel</h2><p>ACTION-PACKED MEDIEVAL DETECTIVE: When a corpse turns up at his favorite tavern, Crispin Guest&#x2014;disgraced knight turned detective--begins an inquiry, but the dead man turns out to be a Templar knight, an order thought to be extinct for 75 years, charged with protecting a certain religious relic which is now missing. Before he can begin to investigate, Crispin is abducted by shadowy men who are said to be minions of the French anti-pope. Further complicating matters are two women: one from court with an enticing proposition, and another from Crispin&#x2019;s past, dredging up long-forgotten emotions he would rather have left behind. And as if all that weren&#x2019;t enough, a cunning young cutpurse by the name of Jack Tucker has insinuated himself into Crispin&#x2019;s already difficult life. The deeper Crispin probes into the murder, the more it looks like the handiwork of an old friend turned adversary. With enemies from all sides, Crispin has his hands full in more than murder in this intriguing prequel to the acclaimed series. Richmond Times-Dispatch says: &#x201c;Steeped in vivid historical detail, focused on a heroic protagonist and structured toward a shocking and shattering climax, &#x201c;Cup of Blood&#x201d; cements Westerson&#x2019;s bona fides as a master of medieval murder.&#x201d; Booklist says: &#x201c;Westerson paints a murky portrait of a medieval world suitably full of shadowy characters and unexpected twists and turns."

Now, in these pages, Bergin tells us her secrets. First, start with basic recipes: Chocolate Chiffon Cake, Buttermilk Cake, Cheesecake, Brioche, Shortcakes, Puff Pastry, and Pie Dough. Then, as Bergin shows us, you can vary these basics to produce such wonders as Austrian Chocolate Cake, Lemon Buttermilk Cake, White Chocolate Rum Raisin Cheesecake, Apricot Rolls, Peach and Berry Cobbler, Apple Pear Tarte Tatin, Fresh Cherry Lattice Tart, and many, many more.<br><br>The unique ability of Mary Bergin and Judy Gethers, Wolfgang Puck's longtime collaborator, to break down even the most complex recipes into simple basics makes this book perfect not only for seasoned bakers, but also for enterprising novices. To aid beginners, the authors include an extensive glossary of ingredients, equipment, and techniques, as well as numerous practical illustrations that clarify and complement the written text. The instructions are clear and simple, replete with helpful tips and advice.<br><br>In Spago Desserts, you will find everything from Chocolate Chocolate Chip Cookies to Cherry Clafouti. Great Spago staples, such as the sumptuous Opera Cake, are intermixed with simple pleasures -- Brownies, Spago's Old-fashioned Apple Pie, muffins of all shapes and sizes -- and not-so-simple pleasures, such as Tiramisu, Fresh Berry Napoleon with Caramel Sauce, and Chocolate Truffles with Brandied Apricots. For those who wish to indulge less sinfully, the authors have also included a few superb fat-free recipes, such as Grapefruit Vodka Sorbet and Strawberries in Port Wine.<br><br>Bergin and Gethers have worked for years with Wolfgang Puck, Spago's chef and owner, and have mastered the rare blend of classical teaching and innovative spirit that have made Spago in Los Angeles and the new Spago in Las Vegas among the best restaurants in the world. Spago Desserts is a brilliant addition to the Spago line of cookbooks, and, like its predecessors, it is sure to become a modern classic. Now you can make these desserts, whether fat-free or sinfully delicious, at home, exactly as they are prepared in the Spago kitchens.</p><p>Since 1987, Mary Bergin has been head pastry chef at Spago, where her duties have included designing desserts for the late Irving "Swifty" Lazar's annual Oscar-night parties. In 1992, she moved to Las Vegas to open the new Spago restaurant there. She has appeared several times on ABC's Home Show and has contributed to various cookbooks, including Wolfgang Puck's Adventures in the Kitchen. Her recipes and desserts have been featured in Bon Appetit, the Los Angeles Times, and The New York Times, and on ABC's Good Morning America. She encourages her two children, Jackie and Anthony, to play an active role in tasting and experimenting in the kitchen.<br><br>Judy Gethers grew up in and around restaurants. Her family has owned Rather's, a landmark restaurant in New York City, since 1905. Her first cookbook was The World Famous Ratner's Meatless Cookbook. Since then, she has written The Fabulous Gourmet Food Processor Cookbook, Italian Country Cooking, and The Sandwich Book. Gethers cofounded Ma Cuisine, a cooking school associated with Ma Maison restaurant, and worked with Mark Peel, chef and owner of Campanile Restaurant, on his latest cookbook. She collaborated with Wolfgang Puck on his most recent cookbook, Adventures in the Kitchen, and is now working with him on a new book.Disregard the trendy origins of these 144 desserts, because underneath the lemon curds, the brioche, and the strawberry bavarian creams lies a very interesting idea: that desserts can be layered, altered, and modified much like articles of clothing. Under the tutelage of pastry chef Bergin, of the Las Vegas branch of Spago restaurant, a chocolate chiffon cake becomes an Austrian chocolate cake, and a brioche is transformed into a sticky bun, apple bread pudding, or a ricotta fig tart. Both novel and traditional desserts appear with upscale variations; rather dry explanations of equipment, cooking terms, techniques, and ingredients are intended to reassure novice bakers that this is all just a piece of cake. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Dark Pools: The rise of A.I. trading machines and the looming threat to Wall Street [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2012] Scott Patterson</h2><p>Dark Pools is the pacy, revealing, and profoundly chilling tale of how global markets have been hijacked by trading robots &#x2013; many so self-directed that humans can&#x2019;t predict what they&#x2019;ll do next.It&#x2019;s the story of the blisteringly intelligent computer programmers behind the rise of these &#x2018;bots&#x2019;.

Haim Bodek, the founder of Trading Machines LLC, squinted at the light through red-thatched eyes and returned his gaze to a stack of five flat-screens on his desk. The only sound in the room was the low hum of dozens of Dell computer towers and several Alienware Area-51 gaming computers.<br><br>The sound of the Machine.<br><br>It was December 2009. Bodek hadn&#x2019;t been up all night swilling fine wines and schmoozing with deep-pocketed clients at four-star restaurants in Manhattan. He didn&#x2019;t need to. His firm traded for its own account, and Bodek answered only to himself and to a few wealthy partners who&#x2019;d bankrolled the firm.<br><br>He wouldn&#x2019;t have it any other way. No twitchy investors pulling cash every time the market dipped. And no prying questions about the state-of-the-art Machine he&#x2019;d created.<br><br>No one knew how the Machine worked but Bodek.<br><br>But now the Machine wasn&#x2019;t working. Even worse, Bodek wasn&#x2019;t sure why. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;d been up all night. If he didn&#x2019;t solve the problem, it could destroy Trading Machines--and his career.<br><br>What made the Machine tick was a series of complex algorithms that collectively reflected a two decades&#x2019; tradition of elite trading strategies. Bodek had personally designed the algos using a branch of artificial intelligence called expert systems. The approach boiled down the knowledge gained by experts in market analysis and crunched incoming market data in order to make incredibly accurate predictions. It combined various models that financial engineers had used over the years to price options--contracts that give the holder the &#x201c;option&#x201d; to buy or sell a stock at a particular price within a certain time frame--with new twists on strategies that savvy traders had once used to -haggle over prices in the pits.<br><br>But many of those old-school strategies, geared with cutting-edge AI upgrades that permitted them to compete head-to-head in the electronic crowd, were nearly unrecognizable now. The market had entered a phase of such rapid mind-throttling change that even the most advanced traders were in a fog.<br><br>The problem that threatened Trading Machines, Bodek believed, was a bug hidden in the data driving his ranks of algos, hundreds of thousands of lines of code used by the computer-driven trading outfit that he&#x2019;d launched with sky&#x2019;s-the-limit dreams in late 2007. The code told the Machine when to trade, what to trade, and how to trade it, all with split-second timing.<br><br>Bodek, whose seriously pale skin, high forehead, and piercing blue eyes gave him the appearance of a Russian chess master, was a wizard of data. It was the air he breathed, the currency of his profession. An expert in artificial intelligence, he&#x2019;d made a career of crunching masses of numbers, finding form inside chaos. To discover order in the ocean of information that made up the market required incredible computer power and ingenious trading systems.<br><br>Bodek had both. He was so skilled at discovering patterns in the market&#x2019;s daily ebb and flow that he&#x2019;d risen to the top of the trading world, working first at an elite Chicago firm, packed with math and physics Ph.D.s, called Hull Trading, then inside an elite quantitative derivatives operation at Goldman Sachs, before taking over a powerful global desk at UBS, the giant Swiss bank. In 2007, he broke out on his own and convinced twenty-five top-notch traders, programmers, and quants (an industry term for mathematicians who use quantitative techniques to predict markets) from across Wall Street to join him. He set up shop in Stamford and launched Trading Machines just as signs emerged of an impending global financial crisis. It had amounted to one of the most ambitious trading projects outside a large investment bank in years.<br><br>Despite the bad timing, Trading Machines had fared well in its debut, posting a tidy profit during a time when most of Wall Street was imploding.<br><br>Then something went wrong with the Machine. Bodek was on a mission to fix it. Whatever it was.<br><br>As the morning progressed, Bodek&#x2019;s team of traders and programmers filed into Trading Machines&#x2019; third-floor office space. They stepped gingerly around Bodek as if he were a hair-trigger land mine.<br><br>The slightest pressure could set off an explosion. Not of anger--Bodek was as levelheaded as a fighter pilot--but of talk. Bodek was a legendary talker, a deep well of stories and analogies and long digressions and digressions on digressions. His was a mind trained to focus on minutiae, and it could be exhausting for listeners exposed to its relentless probing, like a powerful searchlight that never stopped sweeping the ground for new information. He could rarely get far into a conversation before he would say with extreme urgency something along the lines of &#x201c;What I&#x2019;m trying to say is there are five points I need to make before we can address the first of those ten points I mentioned earlier.&#x201d; Inside the firm, this was known as &#x201c;getting Haimed.&#x201d;<br><br>Bodek wasn&#x2019;t in the mood to talk that morning. His eyes darkly circled, he sat frozen in his chair, staring at his stacked monitors, mumbling to himself in fits and starts, his hands rising on occasion from his keyboard to pincer his blade-shaved head above the ears as if he were trying to squeeze more juice from his sleep-deprived brain. All the stress had taken a toll. While he was just thirty-eight years old, he appeared a good decade older.<br><br>Bodek&#x2019;s entire Wall Street career, from Hull to Goldman Sachs to his own trading desk at UBS, had been one long march from victory to victory. Whenever faced with an obstacle no one thought he could overcome, he&#x2019;d pull off a miracle. Failure had never seemed possible.<br><br>And yet here it was. He could see it, there, on his five screens, in the data that tallied up the firm&#x2019;s dwindling profits. As Bodek sat there, mystified by the behavior of an electronic trading ecosystem he&#x2019;d helped invent, he focused his formidable brain power on figuring out what the hell was going on.<br><br>The answer that would solve his problems was also there, he thought, on those screens, hiding amid all the data.<br><br>But where?<br><br>Shortly before 9 a.m., Bodek&#x2019;s partner, Thong-Wei Koh, a six-foot-two crack mathematician from Singapore, took his seat a few desks away from Bodek. The two founders didn&#x2019;t exchange a word. They&#x2019;d been fighting tooth and nail for the past few months. A partnership that had started with visions of glory had descended into a bitter daily feud.<br><br>TW was obsessed with mastering risk. At UBS, he&#x2019;d designed a trading system so ingenious that it could never lose a large amount of money--at least according to the math. But now, at Trading Machines, risk was everywhere. He was drowning in it. He&#x2019;d become so stressed out by the firm&#x2019;s problems that he&#x2019;d come down with chronic stomach cramps. Bodek, for his part, was wracked by headaches and insomnia.<br><br>He began to stir out of his morning torpor as the start of the trading day neared. It was 9:15 a.m.<br><br>Time for the War Song.<br><br>Bodek plugged his iPod into a dock and pressed the play button. Pounding electric guitar chords screeched from the dock&#x2019;s speakers: the manic Viking heavy metal he loved--and everyone else in the room loathed. As a teenager, Bodek had played drums in a thrash band. Ever since, his taste in music had gone one way: loud, angry, violent.<br><br>He was trying to teach his team a lesson with the music. It was how he viewed trading: It was war. Us against them. The market was the field of battle. The weapons: brains aided by powerful computers and lightning-fast algos.<br><br>Head nodding to the earth-shaking metal, Bodek stood wearily from his chair, his tie hanging loosely around his wrinkled white shirt. While Bodek always dressed the part of a white-shoe banker--gold cuff links, silk tie, patent-leather shoes--he relished the contradictions his outfit implied as the Viking metal pounded away. Once, on a dare at a metal show in 2007, he&#x2019;d leapt into a raging mosh pit dressed in his suit and tie . . . and lived to tell about it.<br><br>Clearing his throat, he rapped for good luck the Spartan helmet perched atop one of his monitors and clapped his hands.<br><br>&#x201c;All right, guys,&#x201d; he said, machine-gun drums and psycho guitar riffs pulsating off the walls of the office. &#x201c;Yesterday was bad. We got killed again. But we can&#x2019;t give up. We&#x2019;ve got to fight this motherfucker! We&#x2019;ve got to keep focused! Stay with me!&#x201d;<br><br>There was a reason for urgency. That summer, word had gotten out on the grapevine that Trading Machines was foundering. Now Bodek&#x2019;s top guns were getting poached by competitors who sensed blood in the water.<br><br>To keep the ship afloat, Bodek was doing the work of three employees, staying at the office all night writing code, testing new strategies, digging deep into the guts of the Machine to figure out what had gone wrong. But he couldn&#x2019;t do much more, and he needed everyone to pitch in if the firm was going to right itself.<br><br>&#x201c;I know it looks bad, but we can turn it around, I know it,&#x201d; Bodek said. &#x201c;We can do it! Today we&#x2019;re going to fucking kill it, OK! Now, let&#x2019;s go!&#x201d;<br><br>Everyone turned to his screen and started working. Right as the market opened, Trading Machines got whacked. For months it had been the same. Death by a thousand cuts. Sheer torture. As the nicks and cuts mounted, TW watched in frustration, obsessively clicking a pen, sighing, letting out brief bursts of anger, muttering curses under his breath.<br><br>Suddenly, the Machine froze. Trading stopped. TW pounded his fist on the desk. &#x201c;What the fuck is going on, Haim!&#x201d; he shouted, glaring sharply at Bodek.<br><br>This had happened before.<br><br>Bodek started to scramble, calling up the code he&#x2019;d worked on overnight. &#x201c;Must be a bug,&#x201d; he muttered, frantically typing.<br><br>&#x201c;Goddammit!&#x201d;<br><br>Groans echoed around the trading room.<br><br>Bodek combed through the code and quickly found the problem. A half hour later, Trading Machines was up and running again--only to keep taking losses, again and again, like clockwork.<br><br>Trading Machines&#x2019; nightmare started in the spring of 2009. Bodek had been on a trip to Hawaii for a relative&#x2019;s wedding. For a brief moment, he&#x2019;d had time to relax and reflect on all he&#x2019;d accomplished in the past decade, since joining Hull. He had it all. Money. A beautiful wife, a classically trained musician with the mental chops to match Bodek himself. A beautiful house on the beach in Stamford. Three beautiful children. Most important: He had his freedom.<br><br>When he returned to Trading Machines&#x2019; office in early June, he instantly grew worried. The firm&#x2019;s profits were dropping sharply. Bodek started combing through the nuts and bolts of the Machine, hunting for the problem. He couldn&#x2019;t find it. Since then, Trading Machines had been getting hammered, day after day, bleeding away its gains. It was still making money, but its profits had been reduced by $15,000 a day--sometimes more--all through the summer and into the fall. Now, its gains weren&#x2019;t enough to keep up with the firm&#x2019;s costs, especially the nosebleed salaries Bodek had promised to get all that top-gun talent and the expensive technology his strategy demanded.<br><br>It was a terminal path. Eventually, the firm would run out of cash. The clock was ticking on Trading Machines.<br><br>Through that December morning and into the afternoon, Bodek sat immobile in his chair, mesmerized by his stack of screens. He barely moved, aside from his fingers flying at the keyboard, his bloodshot eyes darting from screen to screen.<br><br>This wasn&#x2019;t unusual. Bodek almost never left his chair during the trading day. He didn&#x2019;t eat or even drink water until the market closed at 4 p.m. He rarely spoke. As he sat there, watching the numbers stream by, he was peering into the depths of the market, reading it like an Egyptologist scanning faded hieroglyphics.<br><br>There&#x2019;s Goldman coming in. That&#x2019;s UBS. Hell, I designed that trade myself in 2005. They&#x2019;re screwing it up.<br><br>Bodek&#x2019;s Machine was screwing up, too. He saw it happen all day long. He knew its signs.<br><br>Like now.<br><br>His eyes widened as he saw another wave coming in. He was tracking the SPDR S&amp;P 500 exchange-traded fund widely known as the Spyder. The Spyder was one of the most heavily traded securities in the world--and one of Bodek&#x2019;s favorites. It was hovering a few pennies above $112.<br><br>Like mutual funds, ETFs represent a basket of stocks, bonds, or other assets such as gold. They&#x2019;re traded as a unit and mimic the value of the underlying assets. Unlike mutual funds, they can be traded continuously on exchanges--like a stock. The first ETF, the Spyder, was created in 1993. It tracked the S&amp;P 500, an index of five hundred of the largest public companies in the United States. Other ETFs tracked the Dow Jones Industrial Average--the Diamonds--and the Nasdaq 100--called the Qs due to its QQQ ticker symbol.<br><br>The funds were like thermometers tracking the health of the market. As such, computer-driven funds, as well as everyday traders, watched them like hawks for any blip in performance.<br><br>One of those blips was about to happen. All was quiet in the room. Perhaps too quiet. Everyone was waiting for the Machine to act. Bodek caught his breath. Now . . . <br><br>Not again.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh fuck,&#x201d; Bodek muttered.<br><br>The Machine&#x2019;s strategy involved rapidly buying and selling stock options. The trouble: Options tend to be extremely volatile and risky. Because of that, options traders normally offset their positions using stock. If the Machine bought an option giving it the right to buy Apple at a higher price within two weeks, it would turn around and sell short Apple stock to protect the position. If the value of the option to buy Apple declined, Trading Machines would make up some of the losses with the short bet on the stock. It was like an insurance policy against a drop in the value of the option.<br><br>Crunching the data spit out by the options market was an enormous task. In the U.S. options market alone, hundreds of thousands of messages were produced every second. To sort through the data in real time required computer power of the highest order, and intelligent systems to make sense of it.<br><br>Any kink in the strategy could cause it to bleed pennies and nickels. And that&#x2019;s exactly what was happening to Trading Machines&#x2019; stock trades.<br><br>Bodek flinched. Over the years, he&#x2019;d developed a second sense for when the market was about to make a move. He could feel a shift coming.<br><br>In a flash, the Spyder ticked down a few cents to $112. The move was so fast the human eye couldn&#x2019;t see it. A person looking at a screen would see a blur, a wiggle at the edge of motion, but it would seem as if nothing had happened.</p><h2>Advancing Biological Farming</h2><p>One of the leading authorities on biological farming, Zimmer is recognized for improving farming by restoring soils. Arguing that an optimally productive soil contains a balance of inorganic minerals, organic materials and living organisms, he relies less on modern improvements than on &#39;&#39;the things we&#39;ve learned by improving fertility in a natural, sustainable way over many years.&#39;&#39; This book offers invaluable scientific support for committed organic farmers as well as conventional farmers who&#39;d like to reduce chemical inputs and use natural processes to their advantage.

Not every trip is going to be a slammer, but if you stay tuned in to your surroundings and what the ocean is trying to teach you, every fishing day will reward you with valuable lessons that will make you a better angler. Capt. Mark Wisch has taken some of the most important lessons he s learned from more than 40 years on the water and shared them in his brand new book, Lessons From a Lifetime on the Water, Eight Essential Rules to Fish By. Wisch s third book following the successful In The Gray and Between Two and Twenty Fathoms is somewhat of a departure from his previous detailed, nuts-and-bolts instructional writing style. Instead, it establishes some fundamental themes for successful fishing and relates dozens of entertaining and funny stories that helped shape Wisch into who he is today an expert angler who still loves learning as much as he does teaching. Those earlier books were like detailed instruction manuals on how and where to catch fish, said Wisch. Writing this book forced me to look at the deeper elements of how I fish, why I fish and why I love it so much. I sincerely hope that reading this will help make others not only more proficient anglers, but fishermen who gain more fulfillment, wisdom and enjoyment from every precious moment on the water, Wisch added. This 208-page, hardcover book will make anybody a better fisherman in more ways than just fish counts. Chapter One, The Natural Order of Things, teaches anglers about the importance of timing. Chapter Two, Above the Sun, explains the key element of positioning. The Extra Mile, the book s third chapter, is about the importance of going the distance. Chapter Four, Soon Comin , teaches patience, a critical and hard-to-learn attribute for angling success. The fifth chapter Details covers all the little things that play such a big part in catching fis</p><p>Captain Mark Wisch owns and operates Pacific Edge Tackle, manufactures a complete line of live bait tanks, writes columns for Western Outdoors, calls in a weekly fish report to Lets Talk Hookup(1090AM) and still finds time to fish aboard his 25 Parker Pacific Edge.

Embroidery on this beautiful fabric has been worked in many countries, but Julia finds the perfection aspired to in traditional Japanese embroidery a wonderful challenge. She learned in Japan by copying the work of a master, and found not only a way to stitch, but also a philosophy that allowed her to achieve balance and harmony in her everyday life. In this inspirational guide she shares her passion and in depth knowledge of the history and practice of this eastern art form. It covers everything from handling flat silk and twisting your own threads to working the different stitches and finishing off an embroidery. Japanese design is influenced by the four seasons, but traditional designs also use the colors and symbols associated with festivals&#x2014;trees, dolls, fish, birds, and mythical figures. A series of simple step-by-step projects, which include the story behind each motif, help the reader to develop their techniques and learn about the symbolism of a great tradition.</p><p>Julia D. Gray&#39;s passion for traditional Japanese embroidery was kindled by her interest in Art Nouveau (which was influenced by Japanese design) and further fuelled by the Great Japan Exhibition in London in 1981. She has studied for nine years with Kurenai-kai, graduating at their centre in Atlanta, Georgia, USA in 1995. Julia researches thoroughly, travelling extensively in Japan to study embroidery and allied traditional crafts including sumi-e (ink painting), yuzen (silk painting), shibori (dyeing) and katazome (stencilling). She gives illustrated talks showing her collection of Japanese antique textiles and artefacts and demonstates at exhibitions throughout Britain. When not working, Julia enjoys photography, gardening and running her smallholding, all of which bring her close to nature - the inspiration for her work.</p><h2>The Ascendant Stars: Book Three of Humanity&#39;s Fire</h2><p>Battle-ready factions converge above Darien, all with the same objective. The goal is control over this newly-discovered planet and access to the powerful weapons at its heart. Despotic Hegemony forces dominate much of known space and they want this world too, but Darien&#39;s inhabitants will fight for their future. However, key players in this conflict aren&#39;t fully in control. Hostile AIs have infiltrated key minds and have an agenda, requiring nothing less than the destruction or subversion of all organic life. And they are near to unleashing their cohorts, a host of twisted machine intelligences caged beneath Darien. Fighting to contain them are Darien&#39;s hidden guardians, and their ancient ally the Construct, on a millennia-long mission to protect sentient species. As the war reaches its peak, the AI army is roaring to the surface, to freedom and an orgy of destruction. Darien is first in line in a machine vs. human war - for life or the sterile dusts of space.</p><p>Michael Cobley was born in Leicester, England, but for most of his life has lived in or near Glasgow, Scotland.

Well, this time there are no shiny, black insects anywhere in sight-just a band of high-steppin' ladies who parade down the streets to town to the beat of a little girl's drum, as rain sprinkles, pelts, and finally pours down on their raincoats and black umbrellas. The rhyming verses from 1 to 10 are interspersed with a rhythmic rat-a-tat line that lends itself to an increase in volume and intensity until the final "boom" sends the women fleeing to get out of the thundering storm. Once safe inside, the undaunted child typically cries, "Let's do it again!" Youngsters will thoroughly enjoy the chance to practice their numbers and to learn this classic childhood song, repeating the in-between chorus line and filling in the end-of-line rhymes. While most of the rhymes work well, occasionally they are somewhat strained, for example "seven/heavens," and a typographical error in verse eight leaves out the word "one" so that the rhythm is disturbed. Still, Manning's clever, full-color spreads are sure to provoke giggles among young listeners, particularly when the rain intensifies and the ever-growing band of racially diverse women has to cope with the rising puddles. The story will surely inspire children to create their own verses and to get up and march about as they sing them.<br><i>Nancy Menaldi-Scanlan, LaSalle Academy, Providence, RI</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.PreS-Gr. 1. The familiar chant that has ants marching gets a clever twist, as the title indicates. The charming cover shows a little girl in a yellow slicker beating a drum and leading a parade of aunts, umbrellas in hand. In this version the aunts march one by one, but the little aunt stops to bang her drum, then "they all go marching down to the town, in the rain, in the rain." Out from the row houses comes one aunt after another (though faster than the song is counting), and almost immediately there are a dozen or more full-figured aunties in raincoats marching down the main street, into the various shops. Like the song, this text gets a little repetitive (at least for adults), but the sassy pictures, with the drama of the rainstorm and aunts of every ethnicity, are fun to look at. The unique perspectives used in the art make this a book kids will want to look at and sing along with more than once. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For a year and a half Faraday's essay-circle met regularly to read aloud and criticise one another's writings. The 'Mental Exercises' they produced are a record of the life, literary tastes and social and political ideas of Dissenting artisans in Regency London. This book is the first to publish the essays and poems produced by Faraday's circle. The complete corpus of the essay-circle's writings is accompanied by detailed annotations, extracts from key sources and a full-length introduction explaining the biographical, historical and literary context of the group. This edition will be valuable not only for historians of Romantic and Victorian science, but for literary scholars and historians working on early nineteenth-century writing, reading and class issues, and for all readers interested in the development of the mind of a great scientist.<br></p><p><br>Alice Jenkins is Senior Lectuer in English at the University of Glasgow and Chair of the British Society for Literature and Science.<br><br>"Jenkins has done an admirable job transcribing these materials and providing supporting scholarly work. Jenkins's book thus not only serves as a window into Faraday's efforts at self-improvement, but also sheds light on a cultural phenomenon among tradesmen in Regency London and illuminates their relation to other, more public, efforts at education. The book will have wider use than simply for those interested in Faraday. It is an excellent contribution to scholarly knowledge of Faraday and the context of science in Regency London."--<em>British Journal for the History of Science</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Goat: A Memoir</h2><p><b>NOW A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE � This&nbsp;searing memoir of fraternity culture and the perils of hazing&nbsp;provides an unprecedented window&nbsp;into the emotional landscape of young men.</b><br><br>Reeling from a terrifying assault that has left him physically injured and psychologically shattered, nineteen-year-old Brad Land must also contend with unsympathetic local police, parents who can barely discuss &#x201c;the incident&#x201d; (as they call it), a brother riddled with guilt but unable to slow down enough for Brad to keep up, and the feeling that he&#x2019;ll never be normal again.<br><br>When Brad&#x2019;s brother enrolls at Clemson University and pledges a fraternity, Brad believes he&#x2019;s being left behind once and for all.

His 87th Precinct novels are international bestsellers. He lives in Connecticut.The real New York City, not the mythical Isola of McBain's popular 87th Precinct series, plays a lead in his devastating new thriller. Uptown Manhattan is where Olivia Kidd forces her brother Sarge to sell his beloved collection of paintings as ordered by their father, a Texas trillionaire. Downtown, Detective Reardon seeks for clues to the gunmen who have shot Ralph D'Annunzio dead in his restaurant. Robberty isn't the motive; there seems to be none nor can Reardon make a connection between D'Annunzio and a second murder victim, a lawyer killed after leaving a stock broker's office. By diligently investigating the dead men's last days, however, the detective begins to put together bits of a puzzle with appalling implications. The murders and other crimes form a graphic picture in Reardon's mind of a great metropolis ravaged by people beyond the law's long arm. These malefactors order killings to silence anyone who might accidentally hear about their deals for vast profits swelling already uncountable fortunes.

I was actually starting to think, as Mason did, that my unoriginal philosophies on positive thinking and deliberate creation were popular because there was some truth to them, that they were more than just regurgitated new age psycho-spiritual babble. And if I were honest with myself, it felt good to believe that. It felt damn good to think I was serving some kind of higher purpose in the world.<br><br>I choked on a sarcastic laugh from my inner bitch, and it sounded like a snort. Higher purpose. Right. Still...I was warming up to the notion that there was a kernel of truth in there somewhere. For me, that's about as close to a spiritual awakening or an "ah-ha moment" as it's ever gonna get.<br><br>So why was I still kinda miserable?<br><br>Mason rolled away from me, sat up and bent forward to pull on his jeans. I glanced at the clock on the nightstand&#x2014;10:00 p.m. "This has to be some kind of a land speed record."<br><br>He stopped with his hands on his button fly and turned to look back at me. He was the sexiest man in the universe. I am not exaggerating. I didn't know why women didn't swarm him in the streets like adolescents mobbing a Jonas brother. (Yes, that's a dated reference. I'm over thirty. You're lucky I didn't say Hansen.)<br><br>Mason leaned over and kissed me nice and slow. "Sorry," he said when I let go of his lips. "But the boys will be home from the movies and&#x2014;"<br><br>I held up a hand. "I know, I know. It's just..."<br><br>"Just what?" He knelt on the bed, his jeans still undone, as he buttoned up his shirt. I thought he could've been on the cover of a steamy novel. <em>Fifty Shades of Brown.</em> Mason Brown, that is.<br><br>"I really have to go," he said.<br><br>"So go, then. You remember the way, right?"<br><br>"Don't be mad."<br><br>I sighed, thinking I was acting like a sophomore pouting over her steady, which was stupid, because this was just the way I wanted it. And because I don't even like sophomores.<br><br>"Don't be dumb. I'm not mad. You're the world's greatest uncle, and you're also all they have. Besides their grandmother, the queen of cold."<br><br>"Easy, woman."<br><br>I grinned at him, pleased with myself. By insulting his mother, I'd diverted his attention from my petulant little burst of emotional ickiness. "Go on. Tell Josh and Jeremy I said hi."<br><br>He looked at me for a long time, like he was trying to decide whether to say something, or maybe waiting for me to say something more. Then he nodded, kissed me quickly and got up to finish dressing.<br><br>"I've got that meeting with the chief tomorrow," he said. "I'll call you right after, tell you what it was about."<br><br>New subject. Nice. I was uncomfortable talking about...relationship stuff. Heavy stuff. Fortunately, so was he. "I already know what it's about," I said, crawling halfway out of the bed and pulling the little plastic stairs closer. Myrtle, my bulldog, was still snoring, but now she could join me when she was ready. Moving her doggy stairs away from the bed was essential to having good sex. Otherwise she spent the whole time trying to wriggle her way in between us. It was just wrong, you know?<br><br>"Yeah? What's it about, then?" he asked, though he already knew what I thought.<br><br>"The rumors are true. Chief Subrinsky has decided to retire, and he wants you to be his replacement."<br><br>Mason shook his head, sitting down on the edge of the bed to pull on his socks. "I don't think so. This feels different."<br><br>He'd already been wined and dined with Chief Sub in the company of a congressman, everyone from the D.A.'s office, the owner of the <em>Press &amp; Sun-Bulletin</em> and the mayor. He was clearly being groomed for the job, even while insisting he didn't want it.<br><br>I could've smacked him. It paid six figures. Low six, but still.<br><br>"'Feels different,' huh?" I asked. "You're starting to sound like me, Detective Brown."<br><br>"There are worse things." He sent me a wink and a killer smile. His damn cheek dimples were my undoing. How did I live for twenty years without once seeing a cheek dimple like that? He pulled me close and did a better job of kissing me goodbye, then dropped me on my pillows and headed for the door. "I'll call you after the lunch."<br><br>"Okay."<br><br>"Night, Rache."<br><br>"Night."<br><br>He closed the bedroom door on his way out. I rolled onto my side, curled up and pulled the covers over my shoulder, while my inner girlie-girl whined that she wished he could spend the whole night.<br><br><em>This is what we both want. It's perfect. Don't go thinking if a little is good, more would be better. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Just leave it alone. Don't screw this up.</em><br><br>I waited until I heard his car leave, then got up, pulled on a robe and crouched beside Myrtle, who was still snoring on the carpeted floor. "I hear brownies and milk calling my name, Myrt. What do you think?"<br><br>She perked her ears but did not open her eyes. Not that it would matter if she did. She was blind as a bat.<br><br>"You hungry, Myrt? You want to eat?"<br><br>Her head came up a microsecond before she sprang to her feet and said, "Snarf!"<br><br>I scratched her between the ears. "This is good, right? Just you and me and bedtime brownies. Even if you do have to have the low-fat ones from the gourmet doggy bakery. This is the life, Myrt. This is the life."<br><br>I wasn't really convinced, but I figured if I said it often enough I could make it true.<br><br>Mason walked into The End Zone in the suit he saved for weddings. Overdressed for a sports bar, but if this turned out to be another part of the unending audition for the chief's job, then it was perfect.<br><br>Besides, he'd already worn his funeral suit to a couple of the VIP meals the chief had been dragging him to for the past few weeks.<br><br>Grooming him to take over his office when he retired, or so Rachel kept telling him. He hoped to God that wasn't the case. He didn't want the headaches of that much responsibility, the hassles of politics or the boredom of a desk job, no matter how demanding it might be.<br><br>And yet, he was raising two boys now. Their father was dead by his own hand&#x2014;as were a lot of others, though no one else knew that besides Rachel&#x2014;and their mother was in a locked psych unit, after trying to reclaim a bunch of her husband's donated organs. Including the corneas Rachel was currently using.<br><br>Yeah, his family was a mess. And yet Rache still hadn't run screaming. Well, she had. A couple of times. Just not from him.<br><br>The chief-of-police position would bring a massive pay raise and much longer life expectancy. Didn't he owe it to the kids to take it if he could?<br><br>But he couldn't, could he? He'd lied. He'd covered up his brother's crimes and destroyed evidence to protect his surviving family members. He didn't deserve to still be a cop at all, much less chief of police.<br><br>He spotted the chief's boxy flat-top silhouette at a table all the way in the back of the bar, swathed in shadows because the big-screen TV closest to it had been turned off. The only tables near it were empty.<br><br>Another man, taller and almost painfully thin, sat across from the chief with his body angled toward the wall and his head down. He was trying hard not to be noticed, Mason thought, and wondered why.<br><br>The chief caught his eye and waved him over, so Mason made his way to the table, giving the place a once-over on the way. There were only a handful of other customers, and no one seemed to be paying him any undue attention. But the chief's companion was nervous, and that made Mason nervous.<br><br>Chief Sub rose and shook Mason's hand, squeezing too hard and pumping too much. It was his standard greeting. The other man looked him up and down but didn't stand, didn't shake.<br><br>Mason knew his haggard face, had always thought the man looked twenty years older than he probably was. "Judge Mattheson," he said. "Good to see you again."<br><br>"Wish it was under different circumstances," the man replied.<br><br>He honestly looked like a stiff wind would carry him a couple of blocks. And old, older than Mason recalled. The guy had to be pushing sixty, but he looked eighty-five.<br><br>"What circumstances are we talking about?" Mason walked around the table to take the chair that faced outward, toward the rest of the bar. This was not about any promotion the chief might be thinking about for him. This was something else. Something private, and something dark. He knew all that before he even sat down.<br><br>Chief Sub leaned over the table. "Howard's daughter&#x2014;"<br><br>"This has to be discreet, Brown." The judge smacked the table to punctuate his interruption and make it seem just a little bit ruder. "You reading me? Discreet, until and unless we have reason not to be."<br><br>Howard Mattheson's face was age-spotted to hell and gone up close like this. No, wait, those were the remnants of freckles. He must have been a ginger as a younger man. Little remained of his hair. It was thin and had faded to a colorless shade that couldn't even be called gray. Tough to tell if it had ever been red. "What is it I'm being discreet about?"<br><br>A waitress came by to ask Mason what he wanted. He glanced at the drinks in front of the other two. Chief Sub had a Coke, straight up. He wouldn't add anything on the job. Judge Mattheson had what looked and smelled like bourbon, neat. "I don't suppose you have coffee."<br><br>"I just brewed a fresh pot."<br><br>"You're an angel."<br><br>She winked at him and left them alone.<br><br>Silence stretched like a rubber band until the chief stopped it from snapping. "Howard?"<br><br>"Yeah. All right. It's my daughter, Stephanie&#x2014; Stevie, as she insists on calling herself. She's disappeared."<br><br>Mason sat up a little straighter. "How old?"<br><br>"Twenty."<br><br>"And you're not filing a missing persons report because.?"<br><br>"Because I'm not convinced this is anything other than a temper tantrum. Look, she was in a car accident last September. Drunk driver. It took her eyesight."<br><br><em>A month after Rachel got hers back.</em> Mason swore silently but didn't interrupt.<br><br>"We kept it quiet. We're a private family, Brown. We like our space. I've always tried to keep my job separate from my personal life."<br><br>"I respect that, Judge." He slanted a look at the chief. He needed to know what exactly was going on here, and he needed to know now. If there was a twenty-year-old blind girl out there on her own somewhere, they ought to be finding her and hauling her right back home.<br><br>Rachel would probably kick his ass for that reaction. He could hear her in his head right then, voice dripping sarcasm like honey. <em>Since when is</em> blind <em>a synonym for</em> helpless? <em>Dumb-ass.</em><br><br>He almost grinned, then bit his lip just in time and pulled out his smartphone to start taking notes. "Give me everything you know, then."<br><br>The judge cleared his throat. "She was told two months ago that there was no hope of getting her eyesight back. She didn't take it well. She's furious with the world and everything in it. Moody and morose. She hasn't accepted her blindness, won't even try, and resents the help we've been trying to get for her."<br><br>"Help?" Mason asked.<br><br>The judge took a sip of his bourbon, set the glass down again and stared into the liquid at the bottom. "Therapy, a personal coach to help her learn how to live with it." He slugged back the last of the bourbon, then held the glass over his head to signal his desire for a refill. "She gives that poor woman so much trouble I'm surprised she hasn't quit."<br><br>"That woman have a name?"<br><br>"Loren Markovich." Judge Mattheson set his empty glass down, fished a business card from his pocket and put it on the table.<br><br>Mason took it and gave it a look. It was one of the judge's own cards, but it had Markovich's name and phone number written on the back. He dropped it into his shirt pocket. The waitress came back with his coffee and another bourbon for the judge, then left without a word.<br><br>"Loren took Stevie out near Otsiningo Park the day before yesterday. Told her to walk to the end of the block and back, using her cane."<br><br>"Alone?" Mason knew he sounded more shocked by that than he should.<br><br>"It's not that big a deal, Mason," Chief Sub told him. "Your friend Rachel could tell you that."<br><br>"Well, Rachel could'a done cartwheels to the corner and back, but that's Rachel."<br><br>"Who the hell is Rachel?" the judge snapped.<br><br>"She's my&#x2014; She helps me with cases from time to time."<br><br>"No one else comes in on this, Brown," Mattheson said. <em>"No one."</em><br><br>"We know, Howard." Chief Sub nodded at him to go on.</p><h2>Glass, Vol. 2: Bottles, Lamps and Other Objects (The Knopf Collectors&#39; Guides to American Antiques)</h2><p>Provides price listings and detailed descriptions of a variety of American glass items ranging from the Colonial period to 1950</p><p></p><h2>The Kybalion: A Study of The Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece</h2><p>The Kybalion: A Study of The Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece is a concise and elegant treatise on occultism and High Magic in Greece and Egypt.

There&#39;s power in anger, sure, a power that can help you survive. But true wisdom is in knowing when to let it go. In Still Waters, Jennifer Lauck continues the riveting true story begun in her critically acclaimed memoir, Blackbird. Clutching her pink trunk filled with secret treasures, the last relics of a lost childhood, twelve-year-old Jenny steps off a bus in Reno and straight into the wide-open future, where no path is certain except that of her own heart....Separated from her brother, Bryan, and passed from caretaker to caretaker, Jenny endures as she always has: by following the inner compass of the survivor. But when Bryan chooses a shocking, tragic destiny, Jenny must at last confront the secrets, lies, and loneliness that have held her prisoner for years. Embarking on a search for answers, the adult Jenny discovers that the past cannot be locked away forever -- even when unraveling one&#39;s own anger and pain seems an impossible feat. Now, in the warmth and understanding of her marriage, in the eyes of her child, and in powerful conversations with a dynamic young priest, Jennifer finds her own miracles. A hardened heart learns to love. A damaged soul finds peace. And life, once merely a matter of survival, becomes rich with the joys of truly living.</p><p>Readers who breathed a sigh of relief at the end of <i>Blackbird</i>, when 12-year-old orphan Jennifer Lauck was rescued from an abusive stepmother, will have to grit their teeth all over again for the second volume of her memoirs. Jennifer is adopted by her father's sister Peggy and her husband Dick Duemore: he's bullying and mean; she means well but doesn't want to hear anything negative and responds with cold anger to Jennifer's unwanted confidences and insufficiently cheerful behavior. She never feels wanted in a house where she seems valued only for the chores she performs---never well enough for Mom and Dad (as the Duemores insist she call them after the adoption), who remind her constantly how grateful she should be. In prose as stark as if it had been scraped with a scalpel, Lauck recounts an adolescence scarred by lovelessness and haunted by unfinished emotional business from her parents' deaths and separation from her older brother, Bryan. She's honest about her rage and inability to trust: we see her rejecting a sweet high school boyfriend and holding Bryan at arm's length during two brief reunions. Bryan's suicide is a low point, but it starts the healing process; she leaves a failing marriage, and the happiness she finds with her second husband helps her come to terms with her past. No one reading this pitiless book will think Lauck has forgiven the relatives whose lies and selfishness had such disastrous consequences for her and Bryan; she's bitter and she has reason to be. "I know there is a power to anger, the kind of power that helps you survive," she muses in a crucial passage that shows her moving on to acknowledge the necessity of "pulling [anger] back in order to make room for the good things like love and understanding and joy." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>When there is a shortage of men during World War II in a rural Michigan town, Myrtle decides to become a preacher. She ministers to her community with wit, wisdom, a practical approach and insights far ahead of her time. But when the war ends, Myrtle must look to her close-knit family for support, as she battles small-town preconceptions that stand in the way of her continuing ministry.

And it might be, if the tourists would only stay at home.<br><br>I stood behind the counter of TenHuis Chocolade (&#x201c;Handmade chocolates in the Dutch tradition&#x201d;) and hated the girl on the other side. I&#x2019;d been working for my aunt and uncle, Nettie and Phil TenHuis, for only a week, and this girl had been in every day, apparently with the sole objective of ruining my life.<br><br>Her name, according to her credit card, was Alana Fairchild Hyden. She would have been pretty if she hadn&#x2019;t been so thin. She was about my age &#x2013; which was sixteen that year &#x2013; and she had dark hair and big brown eyes, which she emphasized with liner, mascara, and shadow until they dominated her face.<br><br>Alana Fairchild Hyden was about the only teenaged customer TenHuis Chocolade ever drew, since Aunt Nettie and Uncle Phil&#x2019;s candy wasn&#x2019;t the kind you&#x2019;d eat in the movies. Oh, they had some inexpensive items, like a milk chocolate sailboat on a stick, but most of their stock was luxury chocolates and fancy dipped fruits. One bonbon cost as much as two Hershey bars.<br><br>But Alana Fairchild Hyden came in every day and bought half a pound of bonbons and truffles, a different assortment every day. She did this, I&#x2019;d decided, to torture me. She got this smirk on her face, and she went through the whole display case, pointing.<br><br>&#x201c;Now what&#x2019;s that one?&#x201d;<br><br>Since I was new, I&#x2019;d have to consult the list. &#x201c;Creamy, European-style caramel in dark chocolate.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How about the one behind it?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;d look at the list again. &#x201c;Raspberry cream.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, the one with the yellow dot.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lemon canache.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yuk! How about the white chocolate with the little nutty things on top?&#x201d;<br><br>That one I knew, because it was my favorite. &#x201c;Amadeus,&#x201d; I said. Then I winced. She&#x2019;d goaded me until I was nervous, and that was when my tongue twisted itself into knots and the wrong word came out. &#x201c;I mean, Amaretto.&#x201d;<br><br>Of course, Alana Fairchild Hyden laughed. &#x201c;&#x2019;Amadeus&#x2019;! How funny! How about the one at the back of that row?&#x201d;<br><br>Back to the list. &#x201c;Frangelico.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Frangelico? Just what the hell is that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask.&#x201d; I turned toward the big window that overlooked the sparkling white room where middle-aged women in white aprons and hair nets produced the chocolates.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, never mind! You&#x2019;d think people would train their employees. Give me four of the fudgy ones and four square ones with the white centers. Then I&#x2019;ll have eight of the dark chocolate balls. The rummy ones.&#x201d;<br><br>Seeting, I put her chocolates &#x2013; four double fudge and four Bailey&#x2019;s irsh Cream bonbons and eight Jamaican rum truffles &#x2013; in a little white box with &#x201c;TenHuis Chocolade&#x201d; in the corner in classy type, and I tired the box with a blue ribbon. I ran her credit card through the imprinter, then pushed the receipt and the card across the counter.<br><br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s your crevasse card.&#x201d; I tried to pretend I&#x2019;d said it right, but Alana Fairchild Hyden laughed.<br><br>&#x201c;You are such a sketch!&#x201d; she said.I tried to look blank. Pleasant would have been more than I could manage. She went out, still laughing, leaving the shop empty, except for the other clerk, Lindy Bradford, and me.<br><br>&#x201c;What a bitch,&#x201d; Lindy said.<br><br>I felt crushed, as well as angry. Alana Fairchild Hyden completely destroyed my confidence. It&#x2019;s just a stupid sales clerk job, I told myself, and I can&#x2019;t do it right because I can&#x2019;t talk like a normal person.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry about it, Lee,&#x201d; Lindy said. &#x201c;She acts rude just to cover up her own inferiority complex.&#x201d;<br><br>I gulped hard and decided it was safe to talk. &#x201c;Who is she?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, she&#x2019;s one of the Hydens. They have that big house at the lake end of Orchard Street. Her grandfather made his money building airplanes. My mother says her mother is trying to spend every cent her grandfather ever made. They&#x2019;re summer people.&#x201d;<br><br>In the week I&#x2019;d been working at TenHuis Chocolade, I&#x2019;d discovered there were three social classes in Warner Pier &#x2013; locals, summer people, and tourists. Locals either lived there year-round, or they owned businesses there and spent most of the year in the area. Summer people owned homes &#x2013; what us Texans would call &#x201c;cabins,&#x201d; but what these Michigan people called &#x201c;cottages&#x201d; &#x2013; and spent several months there each year. Tourists came for periods ranging from a day to a month and rented rooms in the motels, inns, or bed and breakfasts.<br><br>So Alana Fairchild Hyden was a &#x201c;summer person,&#x201d; not a &#x201c;tourist.&#x201d; I sighed. &#x201c;I guess shell be in every day until I leave in August.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who knows?&#x201d; Lindy reached into the showcase and straightened the Italian cherry creams. &#x201c;I feel kinda sorry for her, I guess. She always comes in alone.&#x201d; She shot me a sidelong glance. &#x201c;Hey, three of us are going into Holland to the late show tonight. Ask your uncle if you can come. We&#x2019;ll be home by twelve-thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not tonight,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;But thanks.&#x201d; Luckily, three people came in right then. I couldn&#x2019;t tell if they were tourists or summer people, but I was glad for the distraction. Not that I didn&#x2019;t appreciate Lindy acting friendly. I just wasn&#x2019;t ready to be friendly back. While Lindy told the new customers that we didn&#x2019;t carry candy bars, I stood there miserably and wished I was on the beach. Alone. Without the bag lady I&#x2019;d seen that morning.<br><br>The beach was the best place to cry. That&#x2019;s why I resented sharing it, especially with a bag lady.<br><br>The bag lady scared me. She looked like a homeless old hag, the kind you might see under a bridge in a big city. I hadn&#x2019;t expected to run into someone like that on a Lake Michigan beach, down the road from Aunt Nettie and Uncle Phil&#x2019;s house.<br><br>I kept telling myself she was harmless. But I still resented her. As I said &#x2013; the beach was the best place I had to cry, and I didn&#x2019;t want to meet anybody. <br><br>For one thing, I had always loved the Texas plains. I was used to lots of sky, and Michigan&#x2019;s tall trees made me feel closed in and choked up. But from the beach I could see Lake Michigan stretching west to somewhere beyond the horizon, and it was easier to breathe.<br><br>But all I wanted to do down there was sit behind a clump of beach grass and let the tears roll. I had a lot to cry about that summer. I&#x2019;d lost my family and my friends and had been exiled to work in a chocolate factory.<br><br>My privacy had gone at the same time. Now I was living with my Aunt Nettie and Uncle Phil, and the walls of their house &#x2013; which had been built in 1904 &#x2013; were too thin to hide sniffling. If I cried in bed at night, Aunt Nettie would creep upstairs to be sympathetic.

He has published numerous books, including <i>Fifty Animals that Changed the Course of History</i>. </p><p>Humanity has had a complex and often contradictory relationship with the machine. The development of each new technology has brought about unforeseen transformations in society, politics, economics, and the natural environment, ending, sometimes in a matter of years, ways of life that had endured for centuries. Humans may like to believe that machines are their servants, but as we shall see in this survey of the iconic machines of the past two centuries, they have often been the true masters that have unmade and remade human lives, livelihoods, and lifestyles.</p> <p>The handy man<br> Members of the <i>Homo habilis</i> (2.3-1.4 million years BP) species of hominids, who figure as a major branch in humanity's flourishing ancestral tree, distinguished themselves from their predecessors by their superior ability to make and use stone tools, earning the name "handy man," and setting humanity on the road that would one day lead to the steam locomotive, the vacuum cleaner, the PC, and the Hubble telescope. This survey of iconic machines that changed the course of history does not go back to the invention of the hand axe or wheel, but begins in 1801, with the first successful application of automation to weaving that had until then been the preserve of the skilled artisan. From that time on, for good, or for many of those directly involved at the time, for ill, machines have continued their relentless advance into every aspect of human life and culture.</p> <p>During the First Industrial Revolution (1760-1860), machines revolutionized tool-making (Roberts lathe, page 12; Whitworth planing machine, page 24) and the manufacture of consumer goods, particularly textiles (Jacquard loom, page 8; Roberts' loom, page 20; Corliss steam engine, page 26), whose production became mechanized and automated, turning the skilled artisan into the unskilled factory worker, and transport, with the development of steam locomotives and steamships (Rocket, page 14; SS <i>Great Eastern</i>, page 38).</p> <p>The Second Industrial Revolution (1860-1914) provided a new source of power: electricity (Gramme machine, page 44; Parsons steam turbine, page 52; Westinghouse AC, page 58) and saw an even greater transformation of society as technology entered the office (Linotype, page 46; Underwood No 1 typewriter, page 84; Tungsram light bulb, page 94; Automatic Electric rotary dial telephone, page 98) and the home (Singer "Turtle Back" sewing machine, page 36; Hoover suction sweeper, page 110); and revolutionized transport ("Rover" bicycle, page 54; Diesel engine, page 78; "Model T" Ford, page 104), and popular entertainment (Berliner gramophone, page 60; Lumi�re "Cin�matographe," page 66; Marconi radio, page 72).</p> <p>The manufacturing of the modern world.<br> In what is often called contemporary "postindustrial" society -- rather oddly, I've always thought, as manufacturing industry and technology are still the necessary foundations of all human societies -- machines have relieved humans of the most repetitive tasks in the factory ("Unimate" industrial robot, page 170), home (GE top-loading washing machine, page 146; Victa lawn mower, page 160), and office (IBM PC 5150, page 200); and given humans new ways to fill their increasing leisure time (Baird "Televisor," page 130; Ampex reel-to-reel tape recorder, page 150, JVC HR-3300EK VCR, page 184; Atari 2600, page 188; Sony "Walkman," page 192), to communicate (Hayes Smartmodem, page 206; Motorola "StarTAC" cell phone, page 214), to produce energy (Magnox nuclear reactor, page 164; Vestas wind turbine, page 196), and to travel (LZ 127 Graf Zeppelin, page 126, De Havilland Comet jetliner, page 154). Last but not least, machines have allowed humans to investigate and explore their Universe in ways undreamed of by their ancestors (Siemens electron microscope, page 138; EMI CT scanner, page 180; Saturn V rocket, page 174; Hubble space telescope, page 210).</p></p><h2>Shackleton</h2><p>, xvii, 774 pages, with maps and illustrations throughout</p><p>Sir Ernest Shackleton, the Anglo-Irish explorer, never achieved his goal of reaching the South Pole, though he was knighted in 1909 for having come within 100 miles. With bravery matched only by his theatricality, Shackleton sought to top that accomplishment by landing on one side of Antarctica and traveling the width of the icy continent by sledge. What might have been a great exploratory journey turned into a raw struggle for survival when his ship became trapped in pack ice, and he was forced to lead his team on a desperate trek across hundreds of miles of the world's most dangerous terrain. He made it home, but even his stature as one of Edwardian England's greatest heroes could not save Shackleton from financial risk taking; he ended his life mired in debt. Roland Huntford's biography presents a balanced and lively portrait of a man who was, depending on which of his contemporaries you asked, a national hero or a contemptible rogue. <i>--Robert McNamara</i>Roland Huntford is the author of SCOTT AND AMUNDSEN, which was televised as THE LAST PLACE ON EARTH and republished under that name.

The year was 1974. A hundred thousand people gathered on the ground to watch in awe as twenty-four-year-old high wire artist Philippe Petit made eight crossings between the all-but-completed towers, a quarter mile above the earth, over the course of nearly an hour. Petit&#39;s achievement made headlines around the world. Yet few who saw or heard about it realized that it was the fulfillment of a dream he had nurtured for six years, rekindling it each time it was in danger of expiring. His accomplices were a motley crew of foreigners and Americans, who under Petit&#39;s direction had conpired, connived, labored, argued, rehearsed, and improvised to make possible an act of unsurpassed aerial artistry. In this visually and verbally stunning book, Petit tells for the first time the dramatic story of this history-making walk, from conception and clandestine planning to the performance and its aftermath. The account draws on Petit&#39;s journals, which capture everything from his budgets to his strategies for rigging a high wire in the dead of night between two of the most secure towers in the world. It is animated by photographs taken by two of Petit&#39;s collaborators, and by his own wonderfully evocative sketches and unquenchable humor.</p><p>&#34;It was Philippe Petit who connected the twin towers of the World Trade Center, in an act of beauty and ecstasy. Now that an act of terror has destroyed them both, his book resurrects and reunites them, in sheer defiance of gravity.&#34;--Werner Herzog &#34;Philippe Petit planned and executed the perfect crime by walking on a high wire between the twin towers, and the whole world loved him for doing it.&#34;--Guy F.

Despite the passage of years it still offers travelers in the region an opportunity to see the state from a refreshed perspective. <p>Oklahoma follows the standard WPA guide format; it is divided into three major sections covering the history and background of the state, describing its principal cities, and presenting carefully plotted automobile tours. Perhaps the most interesting and pervasive element of Oklahoma's history is the former Indian occupation of this region. The Five Civilized Tribes--Cherokees, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Creeks, and Seminoles--held the territory for many years before allowing white settlement, and Native American influence on the state's culture remains prevalent today. Because the Oklahoma territories were not opened to pioneers until 1889, the memory of early settlement and statehood was still strong when the guide was first published and the first generation of Oklahomans were told their stories. </p><p>In addition to reminding us of the unique heritage of Oklahoma, the guide book also provides important documentation of the state during the 1930s--that time of economic depression that threatened even the hardiest pioneer spirit. With its discussions of industry, labor, transportation, agriculture, and education, the guide offers a particular insight into the life and lifestyles of Oklahomans of that era. Likewise the descriptions of the cities are vivid pictures of the state's twelve major settlements, dependent in large part on prosperity that flowed from the oil business. </p><p>And the cities, of course, lead the way for the automobile tours. Twenty-two such tours are laid out to permit the traveler--whether on the road or at home--to traverse the state accompanied by keen observations and insightful explanations. Several of the tours include the border cities in Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, and Texas--making this volume truly a find for today's regional explorers. </p><p>This reprint edition both restores an originally composed, but deleted, essay by the historian Angie Debo, and adds a new introduction by Anne Hodges Morgan.</p></p><p>"Twentieth-century America is a good deal more comprehensible because of the WPA guides."--Edwin Newman, former NBC News correspondent and author of <i>Strictly Speaking</i>Angie Debo, Oklahoma's premier historian, was a director of the Federal Writers' Project in the state and the original editor of this volume. <p>Anne Hodges Morgan is president of the Robert S. and Grayce B.

Motorcyclists, including members of the Boozefighters club, engaged in street racing and other raucous activities. A sensationalized report of the event ran in LIFE magazine, along with frightening (albeit posed) photos of the outlaws. Was the event (later portrayed in Marlon Brando&#39;s The Wild One) as wild as reported? Or, in truth, was it even wilder? The answer is found in this book filled with first-person accounts from past and present members of the Boozefighters and others on the scene. This is gripping narrative of a now-legendary event. It&#39;s a true story that is more interesting than the caricatured outlaw legend that has grown up around the name Hollister.</p><p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Read this captivating story and decide for yourself if the Boozefighters were really the outlaws depicted in <i>The Wild One</i>&#x201d;</p> <p>Born To Ride (September, 2005)</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;The original Boozefighters done it and they done it good.

It wouldn't be long before the trees started to turn. Soon after that there would be a riot of color as the Pacific Northwest said goodbye to summer and settled in for a long, likely wet and maybe cold winter.<br><br>He'd missed that. As a kid, all he'd wanted was out of the wet, but after a while spent at Camp Pendleton near San Diego, he'd found the lack of defined seasons oddly disconcerting. It messed with his sense of time passing. And when he'd finally come home, he'd welcomed the shift from summer to fall and winter to spring in a way he never had before.<br><br><i>You never miss it until you lose it.</i><br><br>Terri's voice echoed in his head as the pain jabbed at his gut. He steeled himself against it with the ease of long and frequent practice. The past had been nagging him lately, in all its various ghostly forms. That was usually a signal he'd been living too much in his head, and the cure was something hard, physical and exhausting. Maybe he'd borrow Cutter for a long, mostly uphill run.<br><br>"Crazy dog," he muttered, but he was smiling. The uncannily clever beast had quickly gone from being the pet of his boss's fianc�e to being an amazingly useful member of the team.<br><br>He hesitated for a moment, looking at the small coffee place next door to the groomer's. Another sure seasonal sign; they were putting up the sign for a string of pumpkin spice items. Tempting. He had a silly weakness for them. Maybe he'd pick up a latte and grab a muffin to share with Cutter, who seemed to have an affinity for the particular flavor as well. That would, if nothing else, guilt him into taking that long, hard run.<br><br>After, he decided. He continued toward the groomer's, smiling at the image of a floppy-eared dog in a tub of suds painted on the window.<br><br>A bell rang as he pulled open the door of the small shop. A humming sound from the back halted just as he stepped inside, and a split second later he heard a woof of greeting come from the back. He couldn't see the dog, but obviously Cutter knew he was here.<br><br>"Almost done, be right out."<br><br>The female voice calling from the room at the back was low, even husky, but there was another note in it that made his brows furrow. An unsteadiness or something that was noticeable. He shrugged it off; it wasn't his business. Maybe she had a cold. Or maybe the mess Cutter had gotten into&#x2014; Hayley, said fianc�e and the dog's first chosen person, had said he was mud and muck from nose to plumy tale&#x2014;had required some heavy-duty cleaners, although the only thing he could smell was a faint scent of something that reminded him of cough drops. Eucalyptus or something.<br><br>The humming began anew, and he realized it was a hair dryer of some sort. The image that brought on made him smile, but he had to admit Cutter had enough long, thick fur that it would probably take him hours to dry without the electronic assist.<br><br>He wandered as he waited, feeling a bit out of place here amid the displays of dog stuff. He'd had no idea there were so many different kinds of food and supplements. The toys were more familiar, and a couple made him smile; one designed as a fire hydrant actually made him chuckle. He noticed, here and there, more pictures like the one painted on the front window, featuring the same dog, with various expressions from mournful&#x2014;over the diet foods, he noticed with a grin&#x2014;to silly. Whoever the artist was, he or she had a great imagination, and clearly a good sense of humor.<br><br>He walked toward a few pictures he saw on a side wall. Photos from local 5K and 10K charity runs, in which the shop had apparently participated or sponsored a team. Community involvement. He looked at the people in the shots, wondered if the owner was one of them.<br><br>He stopped in front of a rack of colorful collars and leashes, each one sporting a fabric pattern of varying designs and degrees of whimsy. He picked up one with fire hydrants on it, and again chuckled. Bark Boutique, the tag said, with a website of the same name. He wondered if they did custom work. A collar with alternating doggie angels and imps would be more in order for the irrepressible Cutter.<br><br>On that thought, the dog appeared in the back of the store. Tail up and newly fluffed, he trotted toward Teague sporting his usual attentive expression. With gleaming black fur from his nose to well back over his shoulders, where the thick coat shifted gradually to a rich, reddish brown, and upright, alert ears, he was, Teague admitted, a beautiful animal. But it was the gold-flecked amber eyes and the uncanny intelligence behind them that was his most striking feature. And Teague had quickly learned the intensity in that gaze wasn't effective just on sheep.<br><br>"Hey, boy," he said when the dog reached him and sat expectantly at his feet. "Don't you look all spit-and-polish."<br><br>He reached down to deliver the anticipated scratch behind the dog's right ear. He remembered that Hayley had told him how impressed she'd been when she'd brought Cutter here the first time, and the owner had carefully researched his breed to learn the proper way to groom him.<br><br>"At least, the breed he looks like," Hayley had added with a laugh. It was of no concern at all to her that nobody knew for sure the ancestry of her fey lost waif. "I want to see her make a go of it. I like that she donates groomings to shelter animals, so they can look their best at adoption days."<br><br>Teague liked that himself.<br><br>"You're Teague?"<br><br>The woman called from the doorway to what was apparently the grooming room. Her voice was steady now, whatever he'd heard before gone.<br><br>"Teague Johnson," he agreed as the woman approached. She was tall, maybe two or three inches shorter than his own five-eleven, he thought, attractive in an outdoor, bet-she-could-keep-up-with-you-on-that-run kind of way. Participant, not just sponsor, he guessed, thinking of the run pictures. Her long dark hair was pulled back into a jaunty ponytail he supposed was practical for her work, but also fit with her long-legged grace. She wore scrubs, the damp spots showing that was for practicality as well.<br><br>"Hayley called?"<br><br>She shook her head. "Quinn, actually."<br><br>That his boss had made the call himself didn't surprise him; Quinn never considered much of anything in the way of work beneath him. It was one of the many reasons he was so effective. Not to mention that he was stark, raving crazy about Hayley and would lay down and die for her if necessary. Teague envied him that. If it wasn't so clear the feeling was mutual he might envy him Hayley as well; she was a remarkable woman. The kind Teague had begun to think didn't really exist.<br><br>"I'm Laney Adams," she said, and held out a hand as she came to a halt before him. He took it, firmly but not crushingly. Shaking hands with a woman was always tricky, or seemed so to him. Too strong and they winced, too easy and some seemed to get offended. Laney did neither, she just met his grip and released after a solid shake.<br><br>And didn't seem to feel at all the jolt of awareness that had gone through him at the contact.<br><br>He quickly shook it off. Hadn't rained much yet, so it was probably just some residual charge of static electricity.<br><br>Cutter rose and went to stand beside her, nuzzling the hand he'd just shaken in the way usually reserved for cheering humans up; obviously the dog liked and trusted this woman, and Teague had learned to trust the dog's judgment about people.<br><br>"You work with Hayley?" she asked.<br><br>Teague nodded in answer to her question. And couldn't help noticing the woman's eyes and nose were slightly reddened.<br><br>"Dog soap get to you?"<br><br>Startled, she swiped at her eyes. "I... No. It's fine." She looked away, then down. "I'm sorry, I forgot his collar and tag. I'll go get it."<br><br>She turned on her heel and left quickly. To his surprise, Cutter followed her, although he wouldn't put it past the dog to have understood about the collar.<br><br>He barely had time to appreciate the way she moved when it all tumbled together in his head. Red eyes and nose, that undertone in her voice, and the way Cutter had been nosing at her hand...<br><br>It wasn't soap. She'd been crying. Unease spiked through him. Female tears unnerved him, like most guys. They made him start looking for something to fix, to make it better, and too often there wasn't anything.<br><br>He heard the slight clink of the boat-shaped tag as the now-dressed Cutter approached. According to Hayley, he'd shown up on her doorstep with only that tag, engraved with his name, for identification. All her efforts to find his owner had failed, and in the meantime Cutter had settled in and begun to work his special kind of magic on her grief-torn heart.<br><br>And now he seemed glued to Laney Adams. When she stopped again, Cutter stayed pressed against her leg. He nuzzled her hand again, and the woman petted his head as if instinctively.<br><br>Cutter looked up, his gaze fastened on Teague. He stifled the urge to read "Well? Fix it!" into the dog's expression, knowing it had to be arising out of his own earlier thoughts.<br><br>But there was no denying the intensity of the dog's steady, unwavering gaze. And in the relatively short time since Cutter had come to Foxworth, they had all learned it was wise not to ignore the determined dog when he got "that look."<br><br>He didn't want to ask, but did anyway. "What's wrong?"<br><br>"Nothing."<br><br>"You were crying."<br><br>He was a little surprised when she didn't deny it, but simply acknowledged it this time.<br><br>"Some women can cry beautifully." She shrugged. "I'm obviously not one of them."<br><br>He admired her blunt honesty, but felt awkward. He didn't even know this woman. But Hayley did, she'd said she really liked her, maybe that was why. Friend of a friend in need or something.<br><br>He opened his mouth to ask "Are you all right?" then shut it again. Obviously she wasn't all right, or she wouldn't have been crying. Feeling a bit proud of himself for having avoided a stupid question, he felt even better when she leaned down to scratch Cutter's ear briskly.<br><br>"I'll see you next time, you lovely boy," she said.<br><br>There, another bullet dodged, Teague thought.<br><br>"Let's go, dog," he said.<br><br>Cutter didn't move.<br><br>"Hayley's waiting," Teague said.<br><br>Cutter's tail wagged, and he gave the softer version of the happy bark he always greeted Hayley with in reaction to the sound of her name. But he didn't move from Laney's side. And again he gave Teague that look, that compelling gaze that he had no doubt could drive those sheep right off a cliff if that's what the dog intended. Not that he ever would. No, Cutter was a softie, always seeming to find the walking wounded, the ones who needed help.<br><br>Often, the ones that needed Foxworth-style help.<br><br>Cutter gave a short, sharp yip of impatience. Teague drew back slightly. He did not like how this was shaping up.<br><br>With a long-suffering sigh, Cutter finally left Laney's side. Teague let out a long breath of relief. He'd been afraid there for a minute that&#x2014;<br><br>His thoughts were interrupted when the dog, instead of heading for the door, walked behind him and bumped&#x2014;hard&#x2014;against the back of his legs. Pushing him rather awkwardly toward Laney.<br><br>"Uh-oh."<br><br>The muttered phrase escaped Teague before he could stop it.<br><br>"Something wrong?" Laney asked. "Hayley already paid the bill, if that's what you're wondering."<br><br>"I only wish it was that simple," Teague said, staring down at Cutter, who seemed to realize he'd finally gotten the message. The dog walked back to Laney, sat this time, and looked back at Teague expectantly.<br><br>"He seems restless," she said. "He's usually pretty laid-back with me."<br><br>Teague looked back at her. Her eyes were the color of cinnamon, he thought. He hadn't noticed that before.<br><br>"Laid-back? I'd have to see that to believe it," Teague said wryly. Then, with a smothered sigh, he gave in to the inevitable. "Tell me what's wrong."<br><br>"Nothing." She had herself together now, and clearly wasn't inclined to discuss whatever had been bothering her with a total stranger. He appreciated that, understood it, and normally would have let it end there.<br><br>Except that when Cutter got involved, <i>normal</i> wasn't a word that got used very often.<br><br>Laney inwardly steadied herself. It wasn't really a lie, she told herself. Not sharing personal pain with a total stranger wasn't lying. Maybe denying anything was wrong was, but not pouring out her heart to a man she'd never met before was simply reasonable. Even if she was disposed to see him favorably because he worked with Hayley, whom she'd very quickly come to like a great deal.<br><br>Now, Hayley's fiance, Quinn, was a man she'd found more than a little intimidating the one time she'd met him. But not this man, she thought. In fact, the easy smile, and the way he'd seemed so relieved when she'd refused to talk about the reason for her tears, made him seem much more approachable than his boss.<br><br>Not that he wasn't as attractive, just in a different way. He was a bit taller than she, enough to be appreciated given her own height of five-eight. He looked lean, fit and strong. His eyes were a light, clear blue, and went well with his sandybrown hair. And besides the nice smile, he had an easy confidence she found appealing. She even liked his haircut, buzzed close on the sides, slightly longer on the top. Ex-military? she wondered. Navy was her first thought, this being a navy region, but army and air force bases weren't far, either.<br><br>Cutter nudged her hand again, stopping her musing and making her wonder how long she'd been standing there staring at him.<br><br>"See, he knows it's not 'nothing,'" Teague said.<br><br>It took her a moment to backtrack in her mind, she'd been so lost in her contemplation of the man before her. That was unlike her, and only added to her unsettled state.<br><br>"No," she admitted, "it's not. It's just not something you need to hear." She reached down to stroke Cutter's head once more. "See you next time, Cutter. Nice to meet you, Mr. Johnson."<br><br>She turned to head back to her office. And had to stop when Cutter darted in front of her, blocking her path. Startled, she couldn't help but laugh.<br><br>"Well, I'm flattered, sweet boy, but your mom's probably missing you by now. You'd better go."<br><br>"He's not going anywhere," Teague said.<br><br>Laney whirled around. In her state of mind, the words almost sounded ominous. But the man's expression was so glum and resigned any thought of being in danger from him vanished quickly. She wasn't sure what this man did&#x2014;wasn't sure exactly what Foxworth did, for that matter&#x2014;but she was sure he wasn't a threat.<br><br><i>You thought that about Edward, too,</i> she reminded herself, the thoughts flooding back, a painful contrast to the pleasant diversion of contemplating an attractive man. <i>You thought he was harmless, safe to recommend to your best friend.</i><br><br>"Don't let me see an expression like that and then try to convince me that nothing's wrong," Teague said quietly. "I may not be as smart as Cutter, but I'm not blind."<br><br>She managed a laugh at the joke.<br><br>"I mean it. He knows when people are in trouble."<br><br>"I'm not in trouble." That much, at least, was true. She wasn't the one in trouble. She was just to blame for it.</p><h2>Hoosiers: A New History of Indiana</h2><p><p>Who are the people called Hoosiers? What are their stories? Two centuries ago, on the Indiana frontier, they were settlers who created a way of life they passed to later generations. They came to value individual freedom and distrusted government, even as they demanded that government remove Indians, sell them land, and bring democracy. Down to the present, Hoosiers have remained wary of government power and have taken care to guard their tax dollars and their personal independence. Yet the people of Indiana have always accommodated change, exchanging log cabins and spinning wheels for railroads, cities, and factories in the 19th century, automobiles, suburbs, and foreign investment in the 20th. The present has brought new issues and challenges, as Indiana's citizens respond to a rapidly changing world. James H. Madison's sparkling new history tells the stories of these Hoosiers, offering an invigorating view of one of America's distinctive states and the long and fascinating journey of its people.</p></p><p><p>James H. Madison is the Thomas and Kathryn Miller Professor of History Emeritus, Indiana University Bloomington. His books include <i>Eli Lilly: A Life, 1885-1977</i>; <i>Slinging Doughnuts for the Boys: An American Woman in World War II</i> (IUP, 2007); <i>The Indiana Way: A State History</i> (IUP, 1986); and <i>A Lynching in the Heartland: Race and Memory in America</i>. Madison serves on the boards of Indiana Humanities and the Indiana Historical Society and is a member of the Indiana Bicentennial Commission. He began teaching Indiana history in 1976 and has lectured and consulted widely on Indiana topics.</p><p>"Comprehensive and engagingly written, <i>Hoosiers</i> is the best one-volume history of the state."</p> (Nicole Etcheson, Alexander M. Bracken Professor of History, Ball State University)<br><br><p>"Every Hoosier should want to read James H. Madison's <i>Hoosiers</i>: A New History of Indiana.&nbsp;They will learn about their history, for sure, but much more&#x2015;about their traditions, culture, beliefs, the land itself, their attitude toward government and freedom, their global connections, their heroes and villains, what they should celebrate&#x2015;even their shortcomings&#x2015;and the ongoing changes in the Hoosier way of life. Indiana's past, present, and future all come together for the Hoosier reader in this remarkable and easily readable volume."</p> (Lee H. Hamilton, former U.S. Representative (Indiana, 1965-1999); Director, the Center on Congress at Indiana University)<br><br><p>"In <i>Hoosiers: A New History of Indiana</i>, James H. Madison offers readers a compelling, well-researched, and highly readable narrative of Indiana and its people from the ice age to the twenty-first century. A distinguished scholar, he paints a vivid portrait of Hoosier achievements and controversies, and provides a nuanced understanding of the historical roots of Hoosier responses to current-day cultural, economic, political, and social issues. A must-read for all students of Indiana history, this much-needed book brings the state&#x2019;s history to life for anyone seeking insight into the people who gave definition to the word 'Hoosiers.'"</p> (Joanne E. Passet, Professor of History Emerita, Indiana University East)<br><br><p>"Jim Madison, without question the most careful and objective historian the state of Indiana has ever had, has produced what will be for this generation the definitive history of the Hoosier state."</p> (Thomas Hamm, Professor of History, Earlham College)<br><br><p>"We are all of us fortunate that James Madison, the greatest Indiana historian of our era, has continued to research the people and events of the Indiana story and share his powerful insights about them. His latest work provides both a fresh appraisal of our past and an evaluation of our recent direction. This valuable new look at Indiana is a great gift that stands superbly alongside <i>The Indiana Way</i>, his seminal work of a quarter-century ago. We all owe a debt to Professor Madison for enriching the conversation about where Indiana has been and where we need to go."</p> (Randall T. Shepard, Chief Justice of Indiana (Ret.))<br><br><p>"James H. Madison&#x2019;s brilliant new history of Indiana embodies the best of history writing.&nbsp;It&#x2019;s comprehensive not exhaustive, honest not harsh, complex but understandable, challenging but uplifting.&nbsp;Perfectly timed on the eve of our bicentennial, <i>Hoosiers</i> paints a complex portrait of the distinctive Hoosier character and the ongoing tug of war between tradition and change that has shaped the evolution of the state."</p> (Keira Amstutz, President and CEO, Indiana Humanities)<br><br><p>"A towering achievement. Madison has produced a fresh, stimulating, user friendly, and definitive new history.&nbsp;He captures the economic, political, social, and cultural diversity of Indiana and presents a richly illustrated and documented history that makes room for ordinary people, outsiders, and dissenters."</p> (James B.

C. Beaton, Charlotte Carter, Jerome Charyn, Stuart M. Kaminsky, and many other notable authors. 18,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Penzler Pick, June 2001:</b> A quarter of a century ago (and doesn't that make me feel young!), I started a small publishing house devoted to high-quality mystery fiction. When it became a partnership with Warner Books, who subsequently bought it from me outright, it became a fairly good-sized house that published many of the greatest mystery writers of the second half of the 20th century. This excellent anthology features original stories commissioned especially for this celebratory volume by many of these authors, and as you might expect, there are some outstanding stories indeed.<p> Ed McBain's "Activity in the Flood Plain" tells the story of an artist and the Puerto Rican girl he painted until a delicatessen owner took her away to live in Israel, and then the lovely Connecticut woman who falls for him but battles his desire for a new studio to be built onto his house--with shocking results.</p><p> Joe Gores tells of the dilemma of the Chinese grocer who must run a gambling game to pay off a debt but is warned by a Mafia hit man that he must stop the game or die, and the members of Dan Kearny Associates who devise a plan to save his life. James Crumley's poignant tale is about a former whore who buys a second-hand wedding gown, "never used," and waits for the man who has promised to marry her--"after the next job." Donald E. Westlake's story of a reporter, a mad woman, and a young beauty apparently returned from the dead is even funnier and weirder than usual. Lindsey Davis provides a contemporary tale of detection, eschewing her usual ancient Rome for this collection.</p><p> Peter Lovesey is in the collection, and so are Loren D. Estleman, Marcia Muller, Jerome Charyn (with a fine Isaac Sidel story), recent Edgar-winner Joe R. Lansdale, Stuart M. Kaminsky, Archer Mayor, Robert Greer, Margaret Maron, M.C. Beaton, Charlotte Carter, and Beth Saulnier.</p><p> It's a splendid lineup, and a fitting tribute to a publishing enterprise that has continued to flourish as part of Warner Books. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Mysterious Press is celebrating 25 years of quality mystery publishing with The Mysterious Press Anniversary Anthology. Among the 18 contributors who have written stories especially for this book are such major authors as Donald Westlake, Marcia Muller, Ed McBain, Margaret Maron and Peter Lovesey. Mysterious Press editors Sara Ann Freed and William Malloy supply an introduction, while in his foreword Mysterious Press founder Otto Penzler provides a succinct inside history.

Her first two novels, Deceptions and Possessions, were coast-to-coast hardcover and paperback bestsellers. Now with Private Affairs, she is sure to have her most successful paperback yet!.</p><p>Judith Barnard and Michael Fain, a husband and wife writing team, live in Chicago and Aspen, Colorado. All their novels have been bestsellers, both in Britain and America.Honor, love and corruption provide the themes for the new novel by the husband/wife team who wrote the popular Deceptions and Possessions. On their wedding day, Elizabeth and Matt Lovell are forced to "temporarily" shelve their bright dreams of a future in journalism and take over a family business in Santa Fe. Sixteen years later, with two teenagers and a house to support, the Lovells gamble their assets on revitalizing a failing weekly paper. Elizabeth pours her considerable talent into writing a column, "Private Affairs," but Matt's seething ambition is stymied until Keegan Rourke, a wealthy businessman, gives him the helm of a multimillion dollar newspaper chain. Reveling in the view at the top, Matt refuses to see that his integrity is threatened by Rourke's control of the political agenda, and Elizabeth's outspoken distaste for Rourke drives a wedge between them. As his wife's fame snowballs (her column now has national syndication) Matt succumbs to a fast-lane lifestyle, and their relationship crumbles. Curiously flat descriptions of the good life and padded dialogue slow the action, though glitz-and-greed fans may find enough to interest them as the scenes shift from Santa Fe to Houston, L.A. and the ubiquitous hot tubs of Aspen.

While Russian armies fought furiously to defeat the Wehrmacht, Stalins security services waged an equally ruthless secret war against Hitlers spies, as well as against the Soviet population. For the first time, Robert Stephan now combines declassified U.S. intelligence documents, captured German records, and Russian sources, including a top-secret Soviet history of its intelligence and security services, to reveal the magnitude and scope of the brutal but sophisticated Soviet counterintelligence war against Nazi Germany. <br><br>Employing as many as 150,000 trained agents across a 2,400-mile front, the Soviets neutralized the majority of the more than 40,000 German agents deployed against them. As Stephan shows, their combination of Soviet military deception operations and State Securitys defeat of the Abwehrs human intelligence effort had devastating consequences for the German Army in every major battle against the Red army, including Moscow, Stalingrad, Kursk, the Belorussian offensive, and the Vistula-Oder operation. <br><br>Simultaneously, Soviet State Security continued to penetrate the worlds major intelligence services including those of its allies, terrorize its own citizens to prevent spying, desertion, and real or perceived opposition to the regime, and run millions of informants, making the USSR a vast prison covering one sixth of the worlds surface. <br><br>Stephan discusses all facets of the Soviet counterintelligence effort, including the major Soviet radio games used to mislead the Germans&#x2014;operations Monastery, Berezino, and those that defeated Himmlers Operation Zeppelin. He also gives the most comprehensive account to date of the Abwehrs infamous agent Max, whose organization allegedly ran an entire network of agents inside the USSR, and reveals the reasons for Germanys catastrophic under-estimation of Soviet forces by more than one million men during their 1944 summer offensive in Belorussia. <br><br>Richly detailed and epic in scope, <i>Stalins Secret War</i> opens up a previously hidden dimension of World War II.</p><p>"Stephan's thorough, accurate, and objective study provides unprecedented detail and keen insights on one of history's most illusive subjects. It is destined to become the standard work in this field."--David M. Glantz, author of <i>The Battle for Leningrad</i><p> "Stephan's book demonstrates how the Soviets adroitly manipulated both German intelligence and counter-intelligence in masterfully staged strategic deception operations. It chronicles timely lessons for contemporary intelligence professionals and should grace the libraries of today's intelligence services."--John J. Dziak, author of <i>Chekisty: A History of the KGB</i></p><p> "Should be read by anyone interested in the history of intelligence or of World War II."--John Ferris, author of <i>Intelligence in the Second World War</i></p>Robert W.

And as in <i>The Red Shoes</i>, but so rarely in other works of art, it's the art-making that carries the most power and mystery. Julian Donahue is a "creative": a skilled director of commercials who has come to know his limits. Cait O'Dwyer is a singer, and a bit of a comet that Julian somehow catches the tail of. Their courtship--as Julian evades a marriage split by an unbearable loss and Cait shoots single-mindedly toward stardom--is an intricately constructed <i>pas de deux</i> that is both surprising and convincing throughout. It's Phillips's first novel set in the present since <i>Prague</i>, and in its artful structure, style, and heart it's a match for that smart and charming debut. <i>--Tom Nissley</i> <p></p>Arthur Phillips is the internationally bestselling author of <b>Angelica, The Egyptologist, </b>and <b>Prague,</b> which was a New York Times Notable Book and winner of the Los Angeles Times Art Seidenbaum Award for First Fiction.

Designed as the fictional embodiment of Wollstonecraft&#39;s notions against patriarchy and for the rational and emotional independence of women, The Wrongs of Women tells the story of Maria, who makes a disastrous marriage and then must undergo confinement in a madhouse for her rebellion against it. Godwin&#39;s Memoirs of the Author of &#34;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&#34; honored Wollstonecraft&#39;s memory with a frank and detailed account of her life and death, but instead of the profound admiration he hoped to invoke, most contemporary readers felt shock at Wollstonecraft&#39;s sexual freedom and an odd mix of pity and wonder at Godwin&#39;s willingness to share such details of his wife&#39;s life with the world. The College Publishing edition includes an erudite and accessible introduction detailing the changing critical fortunes of both works, and in order to gain an appreciation for the rich cultural contexts of these texts, a selection of contemporary reviews appears in the appendix. In addition, Wollstonecraft and Godwin&#39;s other works and, uniquely, Gilbert Imlay&#39;s novel The Emigrants, are judiciously excerpted.

In the title story, Max, a lawyer and confirmed bachelor in pre-WW I Vienna, attends the opera, where Helene, a singer of Wagnerian heft, is hurt in an onstage accident. She hires Max to file suit; they marry; later, Max takes a mistress. On his wife's death he is free to marry his paramour, but Helene's will dictates otherwise--she knew that forbidden fruit is sweetest. The London grocer in "Doushenka" is obsessed by Russia. Traveling to St. Petersburg, he falls in love with a young ballerina, but their relationship is ended by his sacrifice on her behalf, and for the rest of his life he must be content with the memories of his Great Love. A Great Love is the essential element in these old-fashioned tales, of which "Sidi" is the most celebratory--and blatantly sentimental. Eschewing the angst and alienation discussed in much contemporary fiction, Ibbotson offers leisurely details of a more genteel era whose passing she obviously laments. Her stories, however, are oversweet and ultimately cloying. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.From Ibbotson (Madensky Square, 1988, etc.), a collection of lacy, romantic short-short stories--mainly frivolous and as contrived as a decorative petit four, most with a weightless charm that echoes similar light pieces in the popular magazines of the 20's and 30's. Plenty of pictorial atmosphere, sunny hyperbole, and boy-meets-girl. The title tale sets the tone, with a Vienna of chestnut trees, Strauss, and Sacher's--plus Uncle Max's ``Great Love,'' a years- long secret affair that begins with a purchase of gloves. Old Vienna and old Russia reappear in stories of bittersweet loves and heroic partings. Adultery is a dreadful burden: ``making love'' is just that, and he and she had ``given birth to this devastating product'' as solidly and surely as ``manufacturing steel.'' There are cheerful yarns spun about true love finding a way--across steppes, in an aquarium, and in the Amazon. Among the 19 stories are two grandly funny ones: an ex-opera singer holds periodic deathbed performances, an orgy of forgiving all, except the husband she's not spoken to for 29 years; and an English governess amends the diaries of some tiresomely confessional Russian aristocrats. Slight, scented, and deliciously dated in style--for those with a sweet tooth. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

At the same time, Berlin has also been a dynamic center of artistic and intellectual innovation. If Paris was the &#34;Capital of the Nineteenth Century,&#34; Berlin was to become the signature city for the next hundred years. Once a symbol of modernity, in the Thirties it became associated with injustice and the abuse of power. After 1945, it became the iconic City of the Cold War. Since the fall of the Wall, Berlin has again come to represent humanity&#39;s aspirations for a new beginning, tempered by caution deriving from the traumas of the recent past. David Clay Large&#39;s definitive history of Berlin is framed by the two German unifications of 1871 and 1990. Between these two events several themes run like a thread through the city&#39;s history: a persistent inferiority complex; a distrust among many ordinary Germans, and the national leadership of the &#34;unloved city&#39;s&#34; electric atmosphere, fast tempo, and tradition of unruliness; its status as a magnet for immigrants, artists, intellectuals, and the young; the opening up of social, economic, and ethnic divisions as sharp as the one created by the Wall.</p><p>Founded in the 13th century as a trading post on a windswept Prussian plain, Berlin was something of an accidental capital. It was selected by Chancellor Bismarck after Germany's unification in 1871, in part because the choice of any other city--Munich, say, or Frankfurt--would have provoked terrible regional rivalries. As it was, the rest of Germany simply looked down on the hinterland Berliners as, in historian David Clay Large's words, "parvenus whose civilization was hardly more substantial than the Prussian sands on which their town was built."<p> The people who soon swarmed to Berlin from all over Germany--and elsewhere in Europe--put their scorn for the city aside, and they turned it, writes Large, "into a hothouse of modernity, a place that pursued change like a drug." That change becomes a dominant theme as Large charts the rapid growth of Berlin in the early 1900s from regional backwater to a leading European center of socialist politics and the arts. Berlin's avant-garde culture and freewheeling atmosphere made it a target of the Nazi leadership, which put in motion grandiose schemes of social and civil engineering intended to remake it into an imperial city the likes of which the world had never known. Devastated, instead, by World&nbsp;War&nbsp;II and divided by the victorious Allies for four decades afterward, Berlin was, until recently, gray and unattractive compared with many other German cities--and, writes Large, that suited many Germans who "harbored the conviction that Berlin, the former Nazi capital, had no business being pretty or glamorous." </p><p> In <i>Berlin</i>, David Large brings the city's recent past to life. Though lacking the literary flair that makes Alexandra Richie's wider-ranging history of Berlin, <i>Faust's Metropolis</i>, so readable, it stands as a substantial contribution to the historical literature. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>David Clay Large, Professor of History at Montana State University, is a specialist in modern German history.

But how can we undo self without moving through self, to the very inside of its definition? Where else can we start? Anne Carson&#39;s Decreation starts with form - the undoing of form. Form is various here: opera libretto, screenplay, poem, oratorio, essay, list, montage. The undoing is tender, but tenderness can change everything, or so the author appears to believe. By turns exhilarating and bewildering, lucid and hermetic, Anne Carson is a maverick with a thrilling range of skills. As Charles Simic says, &#39;Carson takes risks, subverts literary conventions, and plays havoc with our expectations. She is a wonder: an unconventional, often difficult poet who has a huge following among today&#39;s readers of poetry and whose work has been honoured with our most prestigious literary awards.&#39;</p><p>Anne Carson was the first woman to win the T.S. Eliot Prize for Poetry. She has also won a Lannan Award, the Pushcart Prize, the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the Griffin Poetry Prize.

He became convinced that direct awareness of ultimate reality was available to anyone willing to resist the distractions of the ego and seek union with God. These 26 essays, written between 1941 and 1960 and for the most part originally published in Vedanta and the West , present mystical practice as the noblest human endeavor. In crisp, clean prose, Huxley avoids the obstacles of speaking about what is by definition ineffable. This well-edited volume will interest readers who wish to know more about Huxley as well as those seeking an introduction to the mystical tradition.<br><i>- Steve Gowler, Wofford Coll.

Identifying the woman is just the first step in what proves to be an emotionally charged investigation. Florence Horvath was an attractive, recently divorced heiress from Florida; she also had a penchant for steamy sex and was an enthusiastic participant in a video depicting the same. Somehow the combination of her past and present got her killed, but no one is talking-not the crew of the <i>Lady Jane</i>, the Fort Lauderdale yacht moored in Paradise Harbor; not her very blond, very tan twin sisters, Corliss and Claudia; and not her curiously affectless parents, living out a sterile retirement in a Miami high rise. But someone-Jesse-has to speak for the dead, even if it puts him in harm's way.</p><p><b>Robert B. Parker</b> was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, the novels featuring Police Chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole&#x2013;Everett Hitch westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, he died in January 2010.Race Week in Paradise, Massachusetts, brings Police Chief Jesse Stone more than the usual problems of bar fights and rowdy revelers when the body of a young woman washes ashore. Scott Sowers clips the flat Boston accents to portray the deputies and townsfolk--not overdone, but spot-on when he uses them. Sowers nicely captures the no-nonsense Stone-- former LA detective, now small-town sheriff. The smart dialogue is delivered in an almost syncopated style, making the best of Parker's "he said/ she said" conventions. Stone's perseverance in tracking a ring of sex peddlers and predators keeps the story intriguing, and his conquest of some personal demons bodes well for future entries in the series. R.F.W. � AudioFile 2006, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Love &amp; Death: My Journey through the Valley of the Shadow</h2><p>On a February day in 2008, Forrest Church sent a letter to the members of his congregation, informing them that he had terminal cancer; his life would now be measured in months, not years. In that remarkable letter, he wrote: "In more than one respect, I feel very lucky." He went on to promise that he would sum up his thoughts on the topics that had been so pervasive in his work-love and death-in a final book. <br><br>Church has been justly celebrated as a writer of American history, but his works of spiritual guidance have been especially valued for their insight and inspiration. As a minister, Church defined religion as "our human response to the dual reality of being alive and having to die." The goal of life, he tells us "is to live in such a way that our lives will prove worth dying for." This last book in his impressive oeuvre is imbued with ideas and exemplars for achieving that goal. The stories he offers-drawn from his own experiences and from the lives of his friends, family, and parishioners-are both engrossing and enlightening. Forrest Church's final work may be his most lasting gift to his readers.</p><p><b>Forrest Church</b> served almost three decades as senior minister and is now Minister of Public Theology of All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in New York City. He was educated at Stanford University, Harvard Divinity School, and Harvard University, where he received his Ph.D. in early church history. He has written or edited twenty-three books, including<i>Life Lines</i>; <i>Lifecraft</i>; <i>Bringing God Home</i>; <i>The American Creed;</i><i>Freedom from Fear</i>; and <i>Love &amp; Death.</i>I read <i>Love and Death</i> as soon as it came out.

I was not prepared for the power of this splendid, soaring book. It totally captured me."&#x2014;Sylvia Ann Hewlett, author of <i>Creating a Life</i><br><br>"In the midst of an extremity for which there is no euphemism-the prospect of his own imminent death-Forrest Church has written a book that defies the usual adjectives. It is poignant, moving, candid, and eloquent; but it is also so much more. <i>Love &amp; Death</i>, a meditation on the end of life, is really a book about life-a book that shows us how to love ourselves and others, how to know God, how to live. I read it with inexpressible gratitude."&#x2014;James Atlas, author of <i>My Life in the Middle Ages</i><br><br>"Forrest Church is one of our great prophetic intellectuals and compassionate voices. His poignant and wise words on the two ultimate realities of our journey-love and death-reveal his grand courage and vision." &#x2014;Cornel West, author of <i>Race Matters</i><br><br>"Forrest Church, a deeply spiritual but always practical visionary, is a minister to us all with this moving and instructive book on the lessons of life and death.

Forrest Church evokes the full gamut of emotions as he probes the meaning of living, dying, and loving. Nothing in this book is theoretical or inconsequential. At its center is truth that will live forever."&#x2014;C. Welton Gaddy, President of the Interfaith Alliance<br><br>"Forrest Church in <i>Love &amp; Death</i>, a deeply moving testament, utilizes his commitment of love to transform our fear of death into a fuller appreciation of life."&#x2014;Derrick Bell, author of <i>Faces at the Bottom of the Well</i><br><br>"Every Christmas Eve, for a quarter of a century, I, a confirmed skeptic 364 other days of the year, have been inspired by Forrest Church's words at All Souls. Now, on reading this magisterial meditation on his-and our-mortality, I understand at last the marvelous anomaly he has brought to my life."&#x2014;James Lipton, host of "Inside the Actors Studio"<br><br>"Forrest Church has given us many gifts of illumination over the years, often using his own life experiences to disclose insights into the nature of faith and hope, but now in<i> Love and Death</i> he has given us the ultimate gift: a treatise on life's meaning revealed in the face of his own impending death. The book is consummate with the man: witty, eloquent, gracious, with not a touch of the maudlin. Once again, Forrest teaches us how most passionately to live." &#x2014;Reverend William F.

She has traveled the world, searching for recipes and entertaining ideas, and has become well-known through her award-winning PBS-TV series, <i>COUNTRY INN COOKING WITH GAIL GRECO</i>. Her home is in the historic waterfront village of Annapolis, Maryland.Tea enthusiasts can rejoice that afternoon tea has been rediscovered as an elegant ritual. In this compilation of teatime repasts at American bed &amp; breakfast inns, Greco shows the varied ways in which innkeepers serve the meal, from the traditional, European formal afternoon teas--complete with English butler, silver equipage, antique linens and clotted cream--to high teas resplendent with hot savories and chamber music to rather ingenious American occasions in which the Civil War, Gone with the Wind , Mardi Gras and snow skiing play dominant roles in decor and cuisine. Despite the occasional spicy Mexican or low-fat herbal tea offered here, Victorian and antiquarian notes resound in most of the inns, and delectable recipes often suggest a British, even Dickensian, flavor, as in Rose Manor's lemon curd mini-tarts, Corner House Inn's kipper pate sandwiches, Bee &amp; Thistle's rhubarb inger jam and Village Inn's trifle with sherry. Writing in a picturesque style, Greco showcases numerous recipes from each inn and makes imaginative yet practical suggestions for creating thematic teatimes at home. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Masterpiece Recipes of the American Club</h2><p>Masterpiece Recipes of the American Club</p><p></p><h2>When We Were Orphans</h2><p>England, 1930s.

Moving between London and Shanghai of the inter-war years, WHEN WE WERE ORPHANS is a remarkable story of memory, intrigue and the need to return.</p><p>When 9-year-old Christopher Banks's father--a British businessman involved in the opium trade--disappears from the family home in Shanghai, the boy and his friend Akira play at being detectives: "Until in the end, after the chases, fist-fights and gun-battles around the warren-like alleys of the Chinese districts, whatever our variations and elaborations, our narratives would always conclude with a magnificent ceremony held in Jessfield Park, a ceremony that would see us, one after another, step out onto a specially erected stage ... to greet the vast cheering crowds."<p> But Christopher's mother also disappears, and he is sent to live in England, where he grows up in the years between the world wars to become, he claims, a famous detective. His family's fate continues to haunt him, however, and he sifts through his memories to try to make sense of his loss. Finally, in the late 1930s, he returns to Shanghai to solve the most important case of his life. But as Christopher pursues his investigation, the boundaries between fact and fantasy begin to evaporate. Is the Japanese soldier he meets really Akira? Are his parents really being held in a house in the Chinese district? And who is Mr. Grayson, the British official who seems to be planning an important celebration? "My first question, sir, before anything else, is if you're happy with the choice of Jessfield Park for the ceremony? We will, you see, require substantial space."</p><p> In <i>When We Were Orphans</i> Kazuo Ishiguro uses the conventions of crime fiction to create a moving portrait of a troubled mind, and of a man who cannot escape the long shadows cast by childhood trauma. Sherlock Holmes needed only fragments--a muddy shoe, cigarette ash on a sleeve--to make his deductions, but all Christopher has are fading recollections of long-ago events, and for him the truth is much harder to grasp. Ishiguro writes in the first person, but from the beginning there are cracks in Christopher's carefully restrained prose, suggestions that his version of the world may not be the most reliable. Faced with such a narrator, the reader is forced to become a detective too, chasing crumbs of truth through the labyrinth of Christopher's memory. </p><p> Ishiguro has never been one for verbal pyrotechnics, but the unruffled surface of this haunting novel only adds to its emotional power. <i>When We Were Orphans</i> is an extraordinary feat of sustained, perfectly controlled imagination, and in Christopher Banks the author has created one of his most memorable characters. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Balance Plan: Six Steps to Optimize Your Hormonal Health</h2><p><br><i>"I can't function without coffee"<br>"I need my daily fix of chocolate"<br>"I look puffy and retain fluid easily"<br>"I'm hungrier than I used to be but never feel satisfied"<br>"I struggle to lose weight no matter what I try"</i><br><br>Sound familiar?<br><br>These are complaints that nutritionist Angelique Panagos hears every day.

His father was a stonemason. He was brought up near Dorchester and trained as an architect. In 1868 his work took him to St Juliot's church in Cornwall where he met his wife-to-be, Emma. His first novel, <b>The Poor Man and the Lady</b>, was rejected by publishers but <b>Desperate Remedies</b> was published in 1871 and this was rapidly followed by <b>Under the Greenwood Tree</b> (1872), <b>A Pair of Blue Eyes</b> (1873) and <b>Far from the Madding Crowd</b> (1874). He also wrote many other novels, poems and short stories. <b>Tess of the D'Urbervilles</b> was published in 1891. His final novel was <b>Jude the Obscure</b> (1895). Hardy was awarded the Order of Merit in 1920 and the gold medal of the Royal Society of Literature in 1912. His wife died in 1912 and he later married his secretary. Thomas Hardy died January 11, 1928."Throbs with a very Victorian sense of geologies, pre-histories and even astronomy; you can feel the planet moving under the feet." <br>--<i>Daily Telegraph<br></i><br>"Inimitably brooding style." <br>--<i>The Times<br></i><br>"Besides my complete identification with its heroine, I loved the sheer relentless power of the writing. What other writer would start a novel with six solid pages of description without introducing a single character?

Rooted in the delicate web of emotions, lies, and truths that bind people together, the story takes place in the primarily Catholic town of Atkinson, Vermont, during the summer of 1960. Here Marie Fermoyle struggles to raise her three children. She already has two strikes against her: she married above her station and now is divorced from her alcoholic husband, Sam. That he is the town drunk and a laughingstock only further marks the Fermoyles.<p> Enter Omar Duvall, a confidence man. He comes to the door asking for bread and sees an opportunity. Soon he has insinuated himself into the Fermoyle family, promising Marie companionship, love, a willing pair of shoulders to share her burden. Twelve-year-old Benjy knows something terrible about Duvall, but, desperate for anything that will make his mother happy, he hides the truth. This silence gives Duvall time to bring Marie to the brink of financial disaster and lead her sons into mortal danger.</p><p> <i>Songs in Ordinary Time</i> includes a chorus of other Atkinson inhabitants: town cop Sonny Stoner and his dying wife; insurance salesman Bob Haddad, so enthralled with his beautiful wife that he's willing to steal for her; and Father Gannon, the young priest with whom Marie's daughter Alice becomes involved; and the Klubock family next door, who epitomize all that is normal to young Benjy.

The invention of a new, equal social role, the individual, gradually displaced the claims of family, tribe and caste as the basis of social organisation. Larry Siedentop asks us to rethink the evolution of the ideas on which modern societies and government are built, and argues that the core of what is now our system of beliefs emerged much earlier than we think. The roots of liberalism - belief in individual liberty, in the fundamental moral equality of individuals, that equality should be the basis of a legal system and that only a representative form of government is fitting for such a society - all these, Siedentop argues, were pioneered by Christian thinkers of the Middle Ages, who drew on the moral revolution carried out by the early church. It was the arguments of canon lawyers, theologians and philosophers from the eleventh to the fourteenth century, rather than the Renaissance, that laid the foundation for liberal democracy. There are large parts of the world where other beliefs flourish - fundamentalist Islam, which denies the equality of women and is often ambiguous about individual rights and representative institutions; quasi-capitalist China, where a form of utilitarianism enshrines state interests even at the expense of justice and liberty. Such beliefs may foster populist forms of democracy. But they are not liberal. In the face of these challenges, Siedentop urges that understanding the origins of our own liberal ideas is more than ever an important part of knowing who we are.

Siedentop was made CBE in 2004.It is a magnificent work of intellectual, psychological and spiritual history. It is hard to decide which is more remarkable: the breadth of learning displayed on almost every page, the infectious enthusiasm that suffuses the whole book, the riveting originality of the central argument or the emotional power and force with which it is deployed. <b>Siedentop</b> takes us on a 2,000-year journey that starts with the almost inconceivably remote city states of the ancient world and ends with the Renaissance. In the course of this journey, he explodes many (perhaps even most) of the preconceptions that run through the public culture of our day&#x2015;and that I took for granted before reading his book. <i>Inventing the Individual</i> is not an exercise in dry-as-dust antiquarianism, still less in pop-historical fun and games. Siedentop&#x2019;s aim has a breathtaking grandeur about it: to persuade us to ask ourselves who we are and where we are going by showing us where we have come from. A challenging epilogue suggests that the answers are not very flattering.

(Robert Skidelsky)<br><br>With <i>Inventing the Individual</i>, <b>Siedentop</b> is not trying to reveal a hidden or suppressed religious impulse in Western modernity but rather attempting to trace a lost genealogy.

(David Gress <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>In his brilliant book <i>Inventing the Individual</i>, <b>Larry Siedentop</b> paints a vivid portrait of the closed world of pagan antiquity.

Serious scholars of history will always pick holes in these works. Yet at their most cogent and pointed, such frankly polemical metanarratives of human history help us to understand better not just the history of the present (to borrow a phrase), but also ourselves. At a time when we on the left need to be stirred from our dogmatic slumbers, <i>Inventing the Individual </i>is a reminder of some core values that are pretty widely shared.

In such acclaimed works as Jaguar, The Lion Hunters, and Cocorico, Monsieur Poulet, Rouch has explored racism, colonialism, African modernity, religious ritual, and music. He pioneered numerous film techniques and technologies, and in the process inspired generations of filmmakers, from New Wave directors, who emulated his cinema verit� style, to today&#x2019;s documentarians.Cin�-Ethnography is a long-overdue English-language resource that collects Rouch's key writings, interviews, and other materials that distill his thinking on filmmaking, ethnography, and his own career. Editor Steven Feld opens with a concise overview of Rouch&#x2019;s career, highlighting the themes found throughout his work. In the four essays that follow, Rouch discusses the ethnographic film as a genre, the history of African cinema, his experiences of filmmaking among the Songhay, and the intertwined histories of French colonialism, anthropology, and cinema. And in four interviews, Rouch thoughtfully reflects on each of his films, as well as his artistic, intellectual, and political concerns. Cin�-Ethnography also contains an annotated transcript of Chronicle of a Summer&#x2014;one of Rouch's most important works&#x2014;along with commentary by the filmmakers, and concludes with a complete, annotated filmography and a bibliography.The most thorough resource on Rouch available in any language, Cin�-Ethnography makes clear this remarkable and still vital filmmaker's major role in the history of documentary cinema.Jean Rouch was born in Paris in 1917. He studied civil engineering before turning to film and anthropology in response to his experiences in West Africa during World War II. Rouch is the recipient of numerous awards, including the International Critics Award at Cannes for the film Chronicle of a Summer in 1961.

She died in 2016.Unlike Brookner's other novels, this one does not focus on a thirtyish, single woman but on a family of European descent living in England. If there is one major character, it is Sofka, the somewhat eccentric widowed matriarch, but her childrentwo boys, two girlsdivide up the reader's attention. Three of the four marry, with their wedding photographs providing jumping-off points for several story linesa neat device, cleverly handled.

And two giants at the foundations of modern science were converging, step-by-step, on the answer: Albert Einstein, an young, obscure German physicist experimenting with measuring time using telegraph networks and with the coordination of clocks at train stations; and the renowned mathematician Henri Poincar�, president of the French Bureau of Longitude, mapping time coordinates across continents. Each found that to understand the newly global world, he had to determine whether there existed a pure time in which simultaneity was absolute or whether time was relative.<br><br> Esteemed historian of science Peter Galison has culled new information from rarely seen photographs, forgotten patents, and unexplored archives to tell the fascinating story of two scientists whose concrete, professional preoccupations engaged them in a silent race toward a theory that would conquer the empire of time. 40 b/w illustrations</p><p>Peter Galison is Mallinckrodt Professor for the History of Science and of Physics at Harvard University. He is a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship and the Max Planck Prize, as well as the Pfizer Prize for the Best Book in the History of Science for Image and Logic.*Starred Review* Many have taken it as proof of Einstein's transcendent genius that he published his epoch-making Theory of Relativity while employed as a clerk in the Bern patent office, a place usually judged more likely to extinguish scientific inspiration than to kindle it. But when Harvard historian Galison takes a close look at that patent office, he sees something quite different. He sees an institution flooded with patent applications for technologies to coordinate distant clocks, applications forcefully highlighting the problem of simultaneity that lies at the very heart of relativity. Perhaps for some few it will diminish Einstein's accomplishment to realize how much his circumstances helped to focus his thinking. But for most it will only clarify his intellectual feat. Galison helps readers to understand how Einstein--no reclusive hermit--both learned from and surpassed contemporary scientists, engineers, and philosophers struggling to redefine time in a world newly unified by railroads, telegraphs, and radio. And no contemporary more closely paralleled Einstein in his pioneering path than the gifted French mathematician and cartographer Henri Poincare. An admirer of Poincare's neglected brilliance, Galison shows how the French scholar independently unraveled most of the mysteries of relativity, even partially anticipating Einstein's key breakthrough in redefining "local time." Still, while Poincare tried to integrate his insights into the Newtonian framework, Einstein recognized that relativity demanded an entirely new conceptual structure. Few books have ever made Einstein's work more accessible--or more engrossing--for general readers. <i>Bryce Christensen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Players need to be smart; not academically but in terms of their thinking. The ones who are dedicated, with mental resilience and a winner's psychology are prospering and will continue to do so as the game evolves. The stupid footballer is dead. <br> <br>Ex-Premiership footballer Paul McVeigh looks back on his professional career and how he learned to play the mental game and gives a look behind-the-scenes into the approach of some of the game's highest performers. <br><br>This book will appeal to sports fans and players who want to get inside the head of top professionals. And if there is one book to be read by players at all levels who want to improve their performance on the pitch then this is it - from someone who hit the heights in top-level sport and is driven to share what he learned along the way.</p><p>Paul McVeigh was a professional footballer for 16 years playing for clubs Tottenham Hotspur, Luton Town, Burnley and Norwich City. Making more than 300 appearances, he scored 43 goals and was a key member of two Championship winning teams, rising to the pinnacle of English football - the Premier League. He also represented Northern Ireland at senior level on 20 occasions.<br><br>Since retiring from football, Paul has worked extensively with youngsters in football academies, established himself as a sports presenter in the national media, and delivered a variety of well-received keynote speeches, seminars and workshops."The best part of the book is McVeigh's discussion of role models, players who have had great success because of their mental awareness...The book is great for football fans who want to get in the head of professional footballers. Think of it as a sneak peak into the mind of an elite player...I wouldn't hesitate buying this book; it will be an enjoyable read for any footballer or sports fan. It covers an area of the game that not many tackle because it takes the right person to author a book like this. McVeigh's successful career give him serious credentials and the ability to talk from experience." - InternationalSoccerNetwork.com&nbsp;"The arc of a professional career and the day by day descriptions of pre-game preparations and post-match recovery alone are well worth the price of the book.

As only Genevieve Foster can do, she interweaves beautiful illustrations with lively text about one of the greatest American Presidents. Learn about Teddy, one man who was truly larger than life!</p><p>Nothing is more critical, I believe, than that children growing up in these critical explosive days should be given an understanding of American history as a part of the history of the world. Every year this grows more urgent, as increasingly rapid communication integrates world events more closely and the impact of foreign affairs on our own lives becomes more serious and immediate. Genevieve Foster wrote this nearly fifty years ago. It resonates with perhaps more truth today. As a result of this clarion call we have sold many of her enduring &#34;World&#34; titles because of the timeless nature of her books. Her writing style is clear, concise and fluid with her greatest strength as a storyteller being her ability to bring her readers right into the minds and times of her characters.From the time that young Theodore Roosevelt comes walking right towards you, you know things are going to happen. They happen and keep happening to this timid and delicate boy who became one of the liveliest, busiest and most forceful of our Presidents. Genevieve Foster knows how to write a story that keeps one reading and yet is a full and skilfully evaluated biography. Theodore Roosevelt&#39;s family relationships are presented with warmth and understanding. Illustrated by the author. --Amazon website. Review for first edition of Theodore Roosevelt published in 1954.</p><h2>Theatres of San Francisco (CA) (Images of America)</h2><p>You read the sad stories in the papers: another ornate, 1920s, single-screen theatre closes, to be demolished and replaced by a strip mall. That&#x2019;s progress, and in this 20-screen multiplex world, it&#x2019;s happening more and more. Only a handful of the 100 or so neighborhood theatres that once graced these streets are left in San Francisco, but they live on in the photographs featured in this book. The heyday of such venues as the Clay, Noe, Metro, New Mission, Alexandria, Coronet, Fox, Uptown, Coliseum, Surf, El Rey, and Royal was a time when San Franciscans thronged to the movies and vaudeville shows, dressed to the hilt, to see and be seen in majestic art deco palaces. Unfortunately, this era has passed into history despite the dedicated efforts of many neighborhood preservation groups.</p><p>Jack Tillmany, former owner of the Gateway Cinema in San Francisco and a revival programming pioneer, brings the city&#x2019;s theatres to life in this amazing selection of vintage images. Drawing from his personal archive collected during a 30-year career in cinema management, he paints a detailed story of the golden age of theatre, both live and cinematic. It was a time of stunning architecture, elegance, and opulence, and this volume is a reminder of the pre-multiplex days when almost every neighborhood boasted its own beloved theatre.</p><h2>The Alphabet of Light and Dark</h2><p>Melding personal, familial, and colonial history, this evocative novel explores the importance of love, family, and self-discovery. A few trinkets found in a sea chest and the fragmented memories of her grandfather's tall tales are all Essie Lewis has left of her family history. After her grandfather's death, Essie returns to Bruny Island, Tasmania, and to the lighthouse where her great-great-grandfather kept watch for nearly 40 years. Beneath the lighthouse, she begins to write the stories of her ancestors. But the island is also home to Pete Shelverton, a sculptor who hunts feral cats to make his own peace with the past. As Essie writes, she finds that Pete is a part of the history she can never escape.<br></p><p><b>Danielle Wood</b> has an arts degree and has worked as a journalist with newspapers and radio and as a media officer for Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service.<br>Set in the remote terrain of Bruny Island off the southern coast of Tasmania, Wood's evocative but static debut novel brings together a pair of troubled would-be lovers as they try to come to terms with their difficult pasts. Essie Lewis, a 30ish oceanographer, returns to the island from Perth to become the lighthouse keeper, a position that has played a prominent role in her family history. As she settles in, she runs into former childhood friend Pete Shelverton, a welder and metal sculptor who has buried himself in the task of ridding the island of feral cats. Wood details Essie's life through a series of diaries and documents from her past that outline the arc of her family; Pete's difficulties with women and socializing in general are less fully drawn. When they do come together, it is brief, awkward and incomplete. The one-note plot and sketchy romance put all of the burden on the island-as-exotic-locale and its history, and on Essie's own past there. The results are often lyrical, but end up less than satisfying. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Cut loose from Moscow in the early '90s, the five "Stans" (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan) discover that their newly found freedom plays tug-o-war with despair and a nostalgia for the certainties of the Soviet past. It's during this time that author Colin Thubron travels the width of central Asia, asking questions about the past, present, and future. Not content to simply bounce from place to place, Thubron travels from person to person, uncovering their many vibrant stories and developing a deep understanding of the area's lesser-known history. Kyrgyz and Uzbeks debate the place of Islam. Koreans and Germans, descendants from forced migrants, wonder if they know enough of their ethnic tongue to return to their homelands. Russians find themselves left behind, disbelieving, as the tide of Russian power recedes toward Moscow. <p> Central Asia was mostly off limits to foreigners during the Soviet years, and while officials are still uncertain about how to deal with a backpack-wearing solo traveler, the locals Thubron meets are not. Thubron finds the heart of Asia in the hearts of its people, swimming in a sea of tea, vodka, and hospitality. From the oldest-known Quran to a deserted Soviet naval base on the shores of a high mountain lake 1,500 miles from the ocean (used to test torpedoes far from spying eyes), Thubron's writing echoes the melancholy emptiness of the wide spaces he passes through. <i> The Lost Heart of Asia</i> is a rare meeting of a marvelous writer and a mysterious land. <i>--Ken Peavler</i></p>A travel book on the newly-emergent countries of central Asia which contain the magical cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, the Kazakh Steppes, the deserts of Karakum and the Pamir Mountains.</p><h2>Marketing of Evil Coral Ridge Ministries Edition</h2><p>Used.

They reveal many never-before-told details of life at sea during wartime and, along with information found in secretly kept war diaries and previously unpublished personal photographs, add important dimensions to the official record. Unseasoned teenage recruits when they first went to sea, these sailors were led by inexperienced college boys more accustomed to yachts than warships. Their ships were untested vessels, designed by a man with no formal training in ship design, and which many viewed as a waste of money. Yet, as Cross points out, these men are credited with helping turn the tide of the war in the Atlantic as they singlehandedly sank some seventy U-boats and captured U-505, the only German submarine taken during the war and the first enemy vessel captured by Americans at sea since the War of 1812. In the Pacific, the destroyer escorts fought in every major battle, side-by-side with Allied battleships and destroyers. But this story is not just about battles. It is also about American genius, hard work, honor and growing up in the Great Depression. The author provides eyewitness details about the historic first step taken to end racial discrimination in the military as African-Americans stepped aboard the destroyer escort USS <i>Mason</i> as full-fledged sailors for the first time and earned a Navy commendation of heroism in the Battle of the Atlantic presented to the surviving crewmen fifty-one years later. Readers also learn about an ingenious invention when a sailor breaks his silence about a secret weapon tested aboard his destroyer escort that rendered a new German radio-controlled glide bomb useless.</p><p>Robert F.

Cross's gift is to create a sense of "being there," with the President who first envisioned this vessel and among the young men, often just teenagers, whose first glimpse of the sea was often from the deck of their DEs.

These are treatments we have either tried ourselves, with good results, or heard about repeatedly from readers over the years. In some cases, there is scientific research to back up the folk wisdom of Doctor Mom. Most of the time, however, it is practical experience and common sense that help relieve mild, everyday ailments. We offer these top twenty tips in the hope that you will also find them helpful.<b>Gin-Soaked Raisins for Arthritis</b>We have received more mail about this "raisin remedy" than any other home remedy we have written about. We don't know how it got started or why it works, but many readers swear it relieves arthritis pain. Ingredients: golden raisins and gin. Empty the raisins into a bowl and pour in just enough gin to cover the raisins. Allow the gin to evaporate (about one week) and then place the moist raisins in a jar with a lid. Eat nine raisins a day. They go well on cereal! (See arthritis for more details and stories.)<b>Black Pepper for Cuts</b>Thanks to Nell Heard and Wendall Dean for this contribution. Wendall is a wood-carver and scroller. His carving buddies always keep a packet of black pepper on hand for times when they cut themselves on sharp tools.Nell, her sister, and brother-in-law Wendall were traveling through Yellowstone in an RV. One evening a mug fell out of a cupboard and gashed Wendall's head. The cut was long but not deep, and Wendall asked Nell to put pepper on it. The bleeding stopped almost instantly, and the cut healed with barely a scarYou may want to keep some black pepper handy in the kitchen and take a packet of pepper on your next camping trip. Not only does the bleeding stop quickly, the wound heals cleanly with little scarring.<b>Archway Coconut Macaroon Cookies for Diarrhea</b>This is one of the tastiest and most unusual home remedies we have ever collected. Donald Agar had suffered from Crohn's disease for many years. Diarrhea was a constant problem. By accident he discovered that <b>Archway Coconut Macaroon</b> cookies helped control the diarrhea better than any medicine he had taken. Lots of people have written to tell us that eating coconut macaroons has stopped their diarrhea.This is the essence of home remedies. The discovery relied on serendipity, but Donald also paid attention to how his body responded. We cannot promise that these cookies will work for everyone with serious diarrhea, but for some people they seem to be amazingly helpful. And for mild diarrhea, there is no reason not to try.<b>Vinegar for Fungus</b>There are so many uses for vinegar it boggles the mind. An otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) recommended rinsing the ear with the following solution: one part vinegar to five parts tepid water. He suggested putting drops in the ear three times a day.Toenail fungus can be unsightly. Try soaking the infected nails for at least fifteen to thirty minutes daily. The recipe: one part vinegar to two parts warm water. Allow six weeks to see a cure. This one worked for Joe!<b>Aspartame for Arthritis</b>This is one of the most bizarre discoveries we have ever heard about. A scientist noticed that when he got up out of his chair after watching a football game, his arthritis pain was greatly diminished. During the course of the game he had consumed a six-pack of diet soda containing aspartame. Putting two and two together, he thought this artificial sweetner might have contributed to his relief. He organized aplacebo-controlled trial involving aspartame (aka <b>Equal, NutraSweet</b>) and confirmed that doses of 76 to 152 mg did indeed provide pain relief, roughly comparable to anti-inflammatory agents. This research was published in the very respectable scientific journal, <i>Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics.</i>1<b>Ginger Tea for Colds</b>We love this remedy and use it whenever we feel a cold coming on. It came to us from a radio listener in the hills of West Virginia but originated with her grandmother in India. Grind about half an inch of fresh ginger root into a paste and place in a mug. Add boiling water and "steep" for several minutes. Strain the clear liquid into another mug, sweeten, and sip. Our symptoms start to subside within about twenty minutes. We drink this in the morning and evening, and our cold usually gets better by the second day.<b>Hot Water for Itches</b>We discovered this technique in the book <i>Dermatology: Diagnosis and Treatment</i> and have been using it ever since we wrote it up in the first edition of <i>The People's Pharmacy.</i>2 Moderate itching (the sort of thing you get from a mosquito bite or mild case of poison ivy without blisters) often responds to a hot water application. The water needs to be hot enough to be slightly uncomfortable but not so hot that it burns (120-130� Fahrenheit). If you let the hotwater tap run for a few minutes this should be about right. A few seconds' exposure is all you need to produce several hours of relief.<b>Aromatherapy for Hair Loss</b>When we read about this treatment for alopecia areata in the <i>Archives of Dermatology</i> (November 1998) we were astounded. The Scottish dermatologists stated that "Cedarwood, lavender, thyme, and rosemary oils have hair growth-promoting properties. These oils have been anecdotally used to treat alopecia [baldness] for more than 100 years."3 They actually studied a less common condition called alopecia areata, a patchy kind of baldness thought to be related to an autoimmune disorderPatients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One group received the following recipe: "<i>Thyme vulgaris</i> (2 drops, 88 mg), <i>Lavandula angustifolia</i> (3 drops, 108 mg), <i>Rosmarinus officinalis</i> (3 drops, 114 mg), and <i>Cedrus atlantica</i> (2 drops, 94 mg). These oils were mixed in a carrier oil, which was a combination of jojoba, 3 ml, and grapeseed, 20 ml, oils ... . The oils were massaged into the scalp for a minimum of 2 minutes. A warm towel was then wrapped around the head to aid absorption of the oils. Patients were advised to use this technique every night."4 The results were impressive. Of those who applied aromatherapeutic oils, 44 percent had improvement after seven months, compared to 15 percent in the control group.<b>Purple Pectin for Pain</b>This home remedy for arthritis pain has generated almost as much mail as the gin and raisins. One newspaper column reader related that her grandmother had been using it as long ago as 1945. Purchase <b>Certo</b> in the canning section of your local grocery. It is a thickening agent used to make jams and jellies. Certo contains pectin, a natural ingredient found in the cell walls of plants. There are two recipes: Take 2 teaspoons of Certo in 3 ounces of grape juice three times a day. As the pain disappears, this can be reduced to 1 teaspoon in juice twice a day. An alternate approach is to use 1 tablespoon of Certo in 8 ounces of grape juice once daily.<b>Fennel for Flatulence</b>We have received numerous solutions for flatulence, but this one seems the most popular A physician's wife wrote to tell us that her husband's serious gas problem was solved whenhe followed this advice from a Hungarian masseuse: 1 tablespoon of flaxseed powder in a glass of juice twice a day, together with two capsules of fennel seed two or three times a day. Others have reported good results following a cup of fennel seed tea two or three times daily. To make fennel seed tea, slightly crush a teaspoon of fennel seeds and pour boiling water over them.<b>Wart Plaster for Splinters</b>Here is another doctor-recommended home remedy. Russell Copelan, M.D., wrote about this one in the <i>Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.</i>5 He suggests adhering a tiny piece of salicylic acid plaster (the kind used to treat warts) over a small splinter for twelve hours. Within a few days the splinter should have worked its way out or moved close enough to the surface for you to easily remove it.<b>Corn Huskers for Slippery Sex</b>Vaginal dryness is a common problem after menopause or certain cancer treatments. Finding an acceptable sexual lubricant can be a challenge. We heard from one couple who used an old-fashioned moisturizing hand lotion called <b>Corn Huskers</b> for twenty-five years. They said it is slippery but not greasy and stays where you put it. Corn Huskers contains guar gum and algin as well as glycerine, an ingredient also found in personal lubricants such as <b>Replens</b>, <b>Astroglide, Maxilube</b>, or <b>K-Y Jelly</b>.<b>Saliva for Athlete's Foot</b>We roared with laughter when we read the letter from a woman who told us that her uncle's little terrier had cured his long-standing case of athlete's foot. Every evening when he got home, he would take off his shoes and socks, put his feet up, and read the newspaper The dog would run to him and lick his feet all over in affectionate greeting. In a few months, he realized that the athlete's foot that had plagued him was no longer a problem.Dog saliva does have some antimicrobial properties. Dutch researchers have identified compounds in human saliva called histatins that have antifungal activity Canine saliva may also have similar properties. Do not try this remedy if the skin is broken, however, since dogs can carry bacteria in their mouths.<b>Coffee for Asthma</b>Asthma can be a serious disease that requires medical management, not home remedies. But we men...</p><h2>Andy Warhol : Men</h2><p>Rarely seen and often created for his own delight, Pop artist Andy Warhol's images of men are among his most personal and sensual work. Collected in book form here for the first time, <i>Andy Warhol Men</i> showcases hundreds of illustrations, paintings, drawings, silkscreens, Polaroid studies, and fine art photographs in a handsome and intimate volume. Mostly nudes, this gallery of delights includes the beautiful boys and drag queens who adorned Warhol's legendary Factory studio, as well as less racy illustrations of notables such as Christopher Isherwood, Truman Capote, and James Dean. Sprinkled with Warhol's perceptively funny observations on love, and a witty reflection on art and desire by Alan Cumming, <i>Andy Warhol Men</i> is a playfully swooning celebration of male beauty.</p><p>Andy Warhol (1928-1987) was an innovative illustrator and revolutionary artist and filmmaker.</p><h2>Brave Eagle&#39;s Account of the Fetterman Fight</h2><p>Relates, from the Indian point of view, the events of the worst defeat suffered by the United States Army at the hands of the Indians</p><p></p><h2>House of the Winds (Emerging Voices. New International Fiction)</h2><p>1960s Korea. A girl stands in the middle of a sunny patch with her mother. The air is full of butterflies (the souls of little children in afternoon naps) and secrets (although they were not secrets at the time).<p> "House of Winds" is a portrait of a family whose lives have been deeply affected by the tumultuous long years of Japanese rule and The Korean War. And it is the story of one mother and one daughter. Young Wife is a magic-wand mother who tells stories of the times when tigers smoked pipes. One day her white summer blouse runs deep red, mango-red and azalea pink. Who knows from where this sudden sadness sprouted?</p><p>Her youngest daughter is our guide through this world in which an American electric iron is so powerful it sets off a coup d'etat. The daughter begins to see "how Korean women, descendents of the she-bear woman and the son of the king of heaven, lived in the folds of history...laughing, wailing, spirit-cajoling, poetry-writing, tear-hiding, bosom-bracing, scheming, fire-breathing."</p></p><p>A book's life, I think, begins long before a single sentence gets to be written. It is a mysterious process. It often begins with an idea or an image that flashes through your mind. And unlike the others, this particular image or idea somehow takes root and sprouts a leaf or two. And it grows into a leafy tree! House of the Winds began like that for me. The particular image from which the book germinated was a very vivid one. It is the image that always came to me whenever I thought of my childhood in Korea. I am not sure but it has to be the earliest memory of mine as it seems to precede all other bits of memory I have. And yet, it is the clearest memory I have. In fact, it's so clear, I often feel like I am right there, standing with my mother in the middle of the sunny cabbage patch behind the little house of ours in Seoul. It is a sunny<p> spring afternoon. The sunlight is so phosphorous - it's like fine gold powder let loose from a bottle - I can almost grab it. And the white butterflies are still there, hovering over the cabbages in white bloom. It was the one perfect, blissfully happy moment every child has, although too fleetingly. I made it the beginning of the book. A little girl standing in a sparkling, sun-soaked world her mother created behind their small, wooden baby blue gate. It was a bright and dreamy</p><p> world of flowers, starched clothes, waxed floors and made-up stories. Before the girl began to discover the stories of women and Korea. Growing up in Korea was like a long story session. Women spilled stories and tears. It seemed there wasn't a woman whose life hadn't been touched by some sort of tragedy. It was the 60s and 70s and Korea was still recovering from the trauma of the long and harsh</p><p> Japanese rule and the devastating Korean War. Some stories I remember and most I don't but it must have been these stories that from an early age made me feel so deeply for these sad but strong women. They made me think about what it meant to be a girl, a daughter, a wife, a mother in a deeply Confucian Korea. And part of a family. For Korean women even at the time didn't quite exist outside the context of family. Of course, House of the Winds, like most fiction, comes from my own distilled experience but I was also drawing upon the trove of the uniquely Korean experience: historical as well as mythical. As I mentioned, it began with a very vivid image from my early childhood. Then it went from there. In the first chapter, I wanted to capture the first moment when the outside world intrudes upon a child's perfect one. Sometimes, it comes in a single shattering jolt, but here they come in successive little incidents. It first takes the form of inexplicable sadness the child feels when she sees her mother's embroidered blouse run colors in the rain. Then one day, she scoots out after her brother to the street corner where a doctor's beautiful wife was murdered on a stifling summer night. Soon the garrulous Pumpkin Wife enters her house with stories and the word "father," making the girl "a child with questions." The child's perfect world is punctured. The girl realizes that her mother -- whom she thought was perfectly happy with her children behind the blue gate -- might not be. House of the Winds is crowded with women who lived in a Korea that no longer exists. I was their exorcist of sorts. I wanted to tell their stories. But ultimately, I was drawing a portrait of a Korean family that is at once unique but also immediately familiar. I remember instantly recognizing the worlds and their emotional maps when I read books like Proust's Remembrance of Things Past, Joyce's A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man and Eudora Welty's One Writer's Beginnings, even though geographically and culturally, they couldn't be more apart from one another. They all struck a cord in me that all human beings must share. This is what I hoped to achieve.</p>Mia Yun was born and grew up in Korea.

One of the most influential political films in history, The Battle of Algiers, by Gillo Pontecorvo, vividly re-creates a key year in the tumultuous Algerian struggle for independence from the occupying French in the 1950s. As violence escalates on both sides, children shoot soldiers at point-blank range, women plant bombs in caf�s, and French soldiers resort to torture to break the will of the insurgents. Shot on the streets of Algiers in documentary style, the film is a case study in modern warfare, with its terrorist attacks and the brutal techniques used to combat them. Pontecorvo&#39;s tour de force has astonishing relevance today. Booklet featuring a new essay by film scholar Peter Matthews, excerpts from Algeria&#39;s National Liberation Front leader Saadi Yacef&#39;s original account of his arrest, excerpts from the film&#39;s screenplay, a reprinted interview with cowriter Franco Solinas, and biographical sketches of key figures in the French-Algerian War</p><p></p><h2>The Diabetic Chef&#39;s Year-Round Cookbook: A Fresh Approach to Using Seasonal Ingredients</h2><p>Are you tired of uninspired, bland meals?

For nine of the next sixteen years, he served three prime ministers - briefly Neville Chamberlain and Clement Attlee - but for much of that time as Private Secretary to Winston Churchill. During those momentous years Colville kept a diary, though this was forbidden by wartime regulations, locking it nightly into his desk at Number 10. Colville seldom left Churchill&#39;s side and the insights and observations he records paint an invaluable portrait of the nation&#39;s most famous leader both in times of war and peace. Transcribed and edited by Colville before his death, this new edition adds material from WWII not in the original hardback.</p><p>Sir John Colville was born in 1915 and educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he won a Senior Scholarship and first class honours in history. He passed his Diplomatic Service exam at an unusually early age. He became a particularly close friend and associate of Churchill, and was closely involved in the creation of Churchill College, Cambridge, where his papers are lodged.&#39;one of the best resources for the war and for government between 1939 and 1955...This edition contains new material added by the diarist along with the excellent editorial matter from the original publication. it is good to have this remarkable, and thoroughly enjoyable diary once again in publication.&#39; CONTEMPORARY REVIEW</p><h2>Facing The River</h2><p><p>Czeslaw Milosz did not believe he would ever return to the river valley in which he grew up. But in the spring of 1989, exactly fifty years after he left, the new government of independent Lithuania welcomed him back to that magical region of his childhood. Many of the poems in <em>Facing the River</em> record his experiences there, where the river of the Issa Valley symbolizes the river of time as well as the river of mythology, over which one cannot step twice. This is the river Milosz faces while exploring ancient themes. He reflects upon the nature of imagination, human experience, good and evil--and celebrates the wonders of life on earth.</p><p>In these later poems, the poems of older age, this Nobel laureate takes a long look back at the catastrophic upheavals of the twentieth century; yet despite the soberness of his themes, he writes with the lightness of touch found only in the great masters.</p></p><p><p>Czeslaw Milosz was born in Szetejnie, Lithuania, in 1911. He worked with the Polish resistance movement in Warsaw during World War II and was later stationed in Paris and Washington, D.C., as a Polish cultural attach�. He defected to France in 1951, and in 1960 he accepted a position at the University of California, Berkeley. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1980, and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

Co-written with author, avant-garde composer and solar yogi Ramon Sender, Being of the Sun opens as a guide to creating one's own religion, and then offers a compendium of spiritual practices the authors found valuable. Like Living On The Earth, Being of the Sun is entirely handwritten in Alicia's flowing cursive script and illustrated on every page with her line drawings, a shining example of her immensely influential original book design. However, unlike the simple brown lines and cover of Alicia's first book, Being of the Sun's design features purple ink throughout, a colorful cover, plus a dozen full color illustrations within. Ramon created sheet music of original spiritual songs he and Alicia wrote for the book.

In American Indian cultures, people used to have visions which became their personal religions or ways of getting high. A vision expands one's awareness and makes living easier and more enjoyable. Many beings have expanded their awareness to blissful states of at-one-ment with the universe. Some have taught other people their methods and beliefs. Many have followed these divine inspirations, but one may discover one's own way, as did these teachers. <p>Open yourself to the possilbility of having visions. Then, prepare for them by feeling your own being and your own environment. The wisdom of all ancient teachings lives in your heart. When you relax enough to hear it, this wisdom can rename you, reclothe you, give you dances, exercises and meditations, ceremonies and recognitions of divinity in everyday life that make your whole day an act of being radiantly blissful. </p><p>There are ways of abandonment and ways of restraint, and a million ways in between, any of which can bring you ECSTASY. </p><p>Abandonment: self-expression, ingestion of a sacrament, improvisational dancing, feasting, sense awareness, wilderness, nudity and costumes, love-making </p><p>Restraint: rules of behavior, study and meditation, exercises and rituals, dietary laws, tuning out of senses, temple or monastery, prescribed dress, chastity </p><p>Your friends can teach you ways to make your life happier and induce bliss states. They can teach you by example; you need not express to the person that they are your teacher, nor limit yourself to one. If you spend a night in the same house, your souls will merge as you sleep. If you meet someone who is admirable to you in every way, including life style, you might surrender to him or her that they may teach you their way. The qualities you admire in them cannot be recognized unless they are resonating in you at the same time. The teacher is a reminder of your highest self, and, in that sense, your guru is you. Animals and trees are also great teachers. Mountains, wind, ocean and sun are teachers. Lessons abound for the observant. </p><p>Every religion was born in one time and place. They do not travel well through time and space. At their best, each religion applies to one person, to a family or to a tribe. To cling to the past is to cherish abstractions. Drawing from experience of the here and now is the way to find your own religion. </p><p>The rest of this book is an example of a homegrown personal religion, which we have been discovering in the here and now of our lives and from teachings which have inspired us. These beliefs and methods of getting high have been discovered in the here and now of thelives of people we have met, so we do not claim them as ours alone. A consciousness is manifesting on the planet in many people at the same time.

Yet in the savagery of the fighting, the courage and determination displayed, and the casualty rates suffered by the units of the 1st Marine Division, it can claim to stand beside them all. Peleliu was a jinxed operation. It is arguable that it need never have been mounted in the first place, since the fast-moving situation in the Central Pacific removed any pressing need to occupy the Palau Islands. When the 1st Marine Division landed they came up against Japan&#39;s new defensive technique - a garrison determined to die where stood in deep, complex bunker systems. The predicted &#39;three-day quickie&#39; turned into a bloody nightmare that lasted for 71 murderous days. Brought to life by the words of the men who fought there, the story of Peleliu is an epic of the Second World War.</p><p>"A concise narrative overview of the American conquest of the island of Peleliu during World War II in an easy to read, appealing format.

Although this battle is far less well known--even amoung the U.S. Marine Corps veterens--than Tarawa, Iwo Jima, or Okinawa, the savagery of the fighting, the courage and determination displayed, and the proportional casualty rates suffered by the units of the 1st Marine Division can claim equal significance. <br>Derrick Wright is an independent scholar and author of "Tarawa--A Hell of a Way to Die" and "Iwo Jima 1945: The Marines Raise the Flag on Mount Suribachi".""Since retirement in 1992, DERRICK WRIGHT was able to devote more time to his lifelong research into the Pacific campaigns of the Second World War.

G. Wells </b><p>H. G. Wells, author of <i>The Time Machine</i> and <i>War of the Worlds</i>, was one of the twentieth century's most prophetic and creative writers, a man who immersed himself in socialist politics and free love, whose meteoric rise to fame brought him into contact with the most important literary, intellectual, and political figures of his time, but who in later years felt increasingly ignored and disillusioned in his own utopian visions. Novelist and critic David Lodge has taken the compelling true story of Wells's life and transformed it into a witty and deeply moving narrative about a fascinating yet flawed man.</p><p>Wells had sexual relations with innumerable women in his lifetime, but in 1944, as he finds himself dying, he returns to the memories of a select group of wives and mistresses, including the brilliant young student Amber Reeves and the gifted writer Rebecca West. As he reviews his professional, political, and romantic successes and failures, it is through his memories of these women that he comes to understand himself. Eloquent, sexy, and tender, the novel is an artfully composed portrait of Wells's astonishing life, with vivid glimpses of its turbulent historical background, by one of England's most respected and popular writers.</p></p><p>David Lodge is the author of twelve novels and a novella, including the Booker Prize finalists <b>Small World</b> and <b>Nice Work</b>. He is also the author of many works of literary criticism, including <b>The Art of Fiction</b> and <b>Consciousness and the Novel</b>."This novel is as scintillating, engaging, and multidimensional as the man whose life and character it faithfully animates . . . Lodge neatly shifts between narrative and probing interview, to reveal the intersections of writer, thinker, and man . . . Ultimately, this novel's sensitive and lively examination of its protagonist's relationships with women is what really fleshes out (so to speak) his attractive character." &#x2014; <b>Christina Schwarz, <i>The Atlantic</i></b><br><br>"A terrifically enjoyable novel . . . <i>A Man of Parts</i> explores, with great verve, Wells's lifelong attempt to honor his own complexity, to be true to himself as a sexual being, a loving family man, a creative artist and an ambitious social thinker . . . Even if you're up on Wells's life and writings, Lodge makes his novel-cum-biography mesmerizing." &#x2014; <b>Michael Dirda, <i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"[A] smart, engaging novel . . . Lodge has made something of a specialty of intellectuals behaving badly in bed." &#x2014; <b>Christopher Benfey, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>"Entertaining and persuasive . . . <i>A Man of Parts</i> allows Lodge to concentrate on comedy and character . . .

With a gnarled finger, she pointed down her throat. A fishbone peeked over the base of her tongue and was easily retrieved. The old woman and the colonel were delighted. The doctor was relieved. This episode was the first of many that led Dr. Bill Close toward becoming the physician and friend to many, including the colonel who became president and then dictator of the Congo. <p><i>Beyond the Storm</i> details Dr. Close's extraordinary experiences during the uncontrollable human storms that crashed repeatedly in the Congo after independence. In July of 1960 chaos erupted when Belgium turned over power to Patrice Lumumba, the first elected prime minister, but kept the keys to the nation's prodigious mineral wealth. Two men, Colonel Joseph D�sir� Mobutu, the newly appointed army chief of staff, and William T. Close, M.D., volunteer surgeon in the general hospital, met, and their lives became intertwined during the next sixteen years.</p></p><p><b>William T.

Like most of Egan's work, the stories focus on science and ideas, sometimes at the expense of the writing. But although Egan may lack a certain stylistic flare, he more than makes up for it with his wonderful visions of the future. Some of the more interesting stories include "Into Darkness," the tale of a rescue worker whose territory is a runaway wormhole, and the title story "Axiomatic," which is about a man looking to find meaning in the senseless death of his wife.From junkies who drink at the time-stream to love affairs in time-reversed galaxies; from gene-altered dolphins that converse only in limericks to the program that allows you to design your own child; from the brain implants called <i>axiomatics</i> to the strange attractors that spin off new religions, Greg Egan's future is frighteningly close to our own present.</p><h2>How To Use a Fake Book: Fakin&#39; Accompaniments From Melodies and Chord Symbols</h2><p>Finally!

Its consequences were greater than those of any other event of the war. Yet the story of the bombing of Hiroshima, the momentous flight into the future of the B29 Enola Gay, has never before been revealed from firsthand sources. Award winning writers Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts separate myth from reality as they retrace the steps that led the world into the atomic age. The authors talked to each surviving crew member and to the scientists and soldiers whose war effort pointed in one direction, toward August 6, 1945, when the first aerial drop of a uranium bomb wiped out most of a city but, ironically, did not stop the war. In addition to their extensive interviews with participants, both American and Japanese, the authors have had access to private diaries and memoirs and government documents until recently classified &#34;top secret.&#34; From these, they have reconstructed the unmatched drama of men racing to perfect and others learning to safely drop the untested and most feared bomb in the world; while in Japan, the Imperial Army planned a defense, centered in Hiroshima, that would take an estimated million Allied lives.</p><p>Max Morgan Witts and Gordon Thomas are the authors of many books including The Day the World Ended, Voyage of the Damned, and Guernica.

Rich in literary delights, filled with spectacular wordplay, and rife with the bawdy humor of Shakespeare&#x2019;s comedies, <b>Tomato Rhapsody</b> is the almost-true tale of how the tomato came to Italy&#x2014;at once a brilliantly inventive fable of love, lust, and longing, and a dazzling feast for the imagination.<b><br><br></b>This is a story born from love&#x2014;a forbidden love&#x2014;between Davido, an <i>Ebreo</i> tomato farmer, and Mari, a beautiful Catholic girl....But it&#x2019;s not only Davido and Mari who have secrets of the heart. Everyone around them yearns for something&#x2014;from Davido&#x2019;s grandfather, who tenderly cultivates the tomato plant he stole on his voyages with Columbus, to Mari&#x2019;s villainous stepfather, whose eye is trained on his stepdaughter&#x2019;s virginity and his neighbor&#x2019;s land. <br><br>Caught in the midst of these passions and machinations is a village full of eccentrics who speak in rhyme, celebrate the Feast of the Drunken Saint, and live a life untouched by the passage of time. The schemes and dreams of these men and women are about to change as what is forbidden becomes too delicious to resist. Tradition, religion, and good taste collide unforgettably in a story about the courage to pursue love and tomato sauce at all costs.</p><p>Adam Schell holds a master&#x2019;s degree in creative writing from Antioch University. He played inside linebacker at Northwestern University, has made two award-winning short films, worked as a screenwriter, directed commercials, cooked professionally, picked grapes and olives in Tuscany, got fired as a food critic, then moved to the <i>left</i> coast with his wife, where he works as a yoga teacher and writes.<i>Chapter One<br> In Which We Learn How an Ebreo Travels Best in Tuscany<br></i><br>Nonno looked east across the roll of his farm at that particular moment in a late&#x2014;summer dawn when the soon&#x2014;to&#x2014;be&#x2014;risen sun threw an expectant hue of orange and purple across the horizon. It was a beautiful sight, indeed, but the day&#x2014;breaking spectrum held a bit too much uncertainty for Nonno's comfort. The old man scrunched his eyes for better focus and continued his gaze outward, searching the horizon for some small harbinger affirming that their travels today would go safely and that he was doing what was best for his grandson. Then, in the distance, it lumbered into view.<br>It was the obstinate old stud, the one inherited along with the farm and the one Nonno loved the most. The donkey paused along the eastern border of the land, atop a slight knoll and between a pair of ancient fig trees. This alone was a sublime image, but when the gnarled beast suddenly dropped its prodigious cazzone to dangle before the horizon, careened its head upward and let go with an impassioned bray, Nonno knew the God of Abraham would be with him and his grandson as they traveled to Florence.<br><br>The mournful cry erupted from the donkey's mouth and filled Nonno's ears as profoundly as the sounding of a shofar on Rosh Hashanah. Against the still morning it was a sound of such magnitude that it rose from the horizon like a gust of wind billowing a ship's sails and drawing all hands to deck. Songbirds quieted and competing roosters halted in mid&#x2014;crow as the lonely bellow ballooned to a mass, teetered on its own enormity and began to roll across the land. The sound, robust, anxious, a touch melancholy, tumbled across the farm, hurdling row upon row of tomato plants before leaping the old farm's wall. It rambled down valley and over hill. It combed through grape vineyards and rustled about olive orchards. It rumbled up the road and breached the village walls. It echoed through narrow streets and wide piazzas. It moaned in wine barrels and whistled through empty oil jugs, moving every like creature to concur until the entire countryside rang with the chorus of a thousand lonely donkeys.<br><br>Allied with the crisp dawn air and amethyst horizon, the bray had a supernatural quality that affected and connected all of our tale's characters. To begin with, it put a smile on the face of the Good Padre as he tended the church's vegetable garden. It eased the anguish of Cosimo di Pucci de' Meducci the Third, Grand Duke of Tuscany, after an awful week in Rome. It disturbed the stomach of Chef Luigi Campoverde as he stuffed ground pork and veal into sausage casings with fennel, sage, salt and yellow raisins. It startled and annoyed Giuseppe, as did anything that seemed to emanate from a power greater than himself, while it thrilled both Benito and Bobo the Fool for the very reason it unnerved their boss. With amorous serendipity it caused our heroine, Mari, to pause while stirring a batch of her favorite olives at the very same moment our hero, Davido, paused as he loaded a basket with tomatoes.<br><br>But for Nonno, the sound of an obstinate and misunderstood beast of burden wailing against an uncaring world was a physical and aural incarnation of what it meant to be an Ebreo in a gentile world, and a tear of both sadness and joy streaked the old man's face. By ways unexpected and through loss unimaginable, Nonno had managed to relocate his family and closest of kin from the ghetto of Florence, with its vicious plagues and politics, to a safer home and farm in the country. A place, he wished, where his extended family could peaceably prosper.<br><br>Though all the children who lived on the farm called him Nonno, his one true grandchild, Davido, was soon to be married, which meant Nonno would have something real to leave him&#x2014;land and a wife. Nonno hoped that under Davido's leadership the farm would blossom into a place where Ebrei from Florence, Siena, Pitigliano, even as far away as Venice and Rome could seek refuge, flee the ghettos and create a new life. Nonno understood that this late&#x2014;coming dream would not reach fruition in his lifetime. He could feel his power waning. His body was still fairly limber and his mind still somewhat sharp, but he knew it was Davido's time to come to the fore and prayed daily for the strength of his grandson.<br><br>He was an odd boy, his Davido, odd in ways Nonno admired and also feared. Goodness knows, Nonno was pleased by the seriousness with which his grandson took to farming. The boy was coming into his own. A year of hard country life had toughened up his grandchild and put a bit of muscle on his skinny frame, but Nonno found the boy's devotion to the tomato a bit obsessive. He had no problem with his grandson's newfound love of the earth, but he didn't want the boy turning into one of those half&#x2014;crazed farmers he knew from the markets of Florence. The kind of folk who mumble and grumble when conversing with another human, yet speak clearly and sweetly when talking to the vegetables upon their stand. Truth be told, the way Davido would talk to the tomato plants&#x2014;his nose pressed closely against the leaves as if to inhale their entirety into the depth of his brain-Nonno was concerned some of this countrified madness had already beset the boy. Nothing a good wife and some children wouldn't cure, thought Nonno. God willing, their trip today would help see to that.<br><br>Il Raglio Sacro, the Holy Bray, echoed into oblivion and returned Davido's thoughts to the day at hand. Woefully, he lowered his gaze from the horizon so to look into the basket held in his hands. His eyes could not help but mist with tears&#x2014;the tomatoes were that beautiful. His first true crop: lush, round, slightly ribbed, a shade of red unmatched in all of nature, with a melding of yellow as the fruit bent and crinkled toward its green stem. What a shame, he thought to himself with an earnestness more appropriate to how the old look upon the young as they're sent off to die in a pointless war. He would rather be doing anything than traveling to Florence today to visit with the girl and the family who in sixteen short days would respectively become his wife and in&#x2014;laws. Davido brought his thought full circle. He had already met the girl once and the notion that fruits so glorious were bound to waste their goodness and vitality upon an ignominious cause pained his heart exquisitely.<br><br>Davido took a few steps forward and set the basket of tomatoes onto the rear of the wagon, sliding it forward so to brace it against another basket. The wagon was nearly full with a dozen similar baskets: presents for old friends and a wife&#x2014;to&#x2014;be in Florence. She wasn't at all like Davido's late sister&#x2014;shrewd, strong&#x2014;willed, adventurous, beautiful&#x2014;and she was nothing near what Davido had hoped for in a spouse. On the contrary, she was shy and skinny and she reminded Davido of himself when he was about her age&#x2014;a puny schoolboy of Florence holed up in the lightless Seminario di Ebrei for hours on end&#x2014;and for this he could not stand being in her presence. She was a child, just fifteen or so, a good five years Davido's junior and the youngest daughter of a successful merchant more than pleased to pawn off the last of his progeny to the grandchild of a legendary Ebreo like Nonno.<br><br>Though Nonno had explained to Davido a hundred times that this was the way things were done&#x2014;that family knew best, tradition dictated the way&#x2014;Davido was not convinced. He was repulsed by the girl, and the fact that their Chituba1 stipulated that they would spend the first year of marriage living together in the home of her parents, in Florence, was a thought so horrible it brought bile to his throat every time he thought it, and he thought it often.<br><br>Davido turned and walked to the rear of the barn. He knelt down and took a handful of hay and set it in the bottom of another wood basket. He slid himself a bit closer to the large burlap cloth stacked with ripe tomatoes-close enough so that he could catch one more whiff of their beloved fragrance&#x2014;and then, one by one, he began to gently set them into the hay&#x2014;lined basket. A layer of hay, a layer of tomatoes, a layer of hay, a layer of tomatoes, two deep and well cushioned for the bumpy three&#x2014;hour ride ahead. It would be a hot journey too, and though the sun had just begun to rise, Davido found himself sweating uncomfortably beneath the heavy robe he wore. With a curt sniff, he caught an anxious undertone in his sweat that always reminded him of rotting onions. Of course, a heavy wool robe worn in summer made him perspire, but it was the girl who caused his sweat to stink.<br><br>The monk's robe was a necessary burden that Nonno had thought up many years ago while hiding about the cities of Tuscany. Nonno realized then that nothing protected a traveling Ebreo like the brown robe of a mendicant monk, a heavy wood cross dangling about the chest and a few well&#x2014;said phrases in Latin. Hence, whenever Davido or Nonno or any of the extended family members living on the farm traveled to Florence, Pitigliano, Livorno or any other city, they did so draped in the hefty robes of Franciscan monks and pulled along by humble donkeys.<br><br>"By and by!" Davido shouted to his grandfather to let him know the wagon was just about set. Davido spread a large burlap cloth over the back of the wagon. The tomatoes would be fine exposed to the sun, but it would be imprudent for a pair of false monks to openly travel with a cart full of Love Apples. It was unlikely that anyone they happened to cross paths with would know what a tomato was, but nonetheless, as Nonno often repeated, it was always best to keep suspicions at bay. Davido then walked into the barn to load a basket with some provisions: a loaf of bread; a hunk of cheese; a few bottles, some with water, others with wine; a handful of figs and a half dozen peaches. He and Nonno would have tonight's Sabbath meal with the family of his betrothed, spend the night with friends in...</p><h2>Everybody Loves Tank Girl</h2><p>Everyone's favorite outback anarchist is back to blow things up, swear profusely and offend the elderly in your household!&nbsp;<br><br>This time, Monsieur Alan Martin teams up with wunderkind Jim Mahfood to bring you Tank Girl as you've never seen her: wild, raw, foul-mouthed and forever rockin' but rendered in a style that will bring pleasure to thine eyes.</p><p><b>Alan Martin</b> is the co-creator of Tank Girl (along with artist Jamie Hewlett), and writer of the Tank Girl graphic novels.

Robbins Landon and acclaimed historian John Julius Norwich combine their talents in examining the unique role of music in the life of Venice and Venice in the life of music. The book is a lavishly illustrated celebration that truly captures the spirit and music of this beautiful city. There are 231 illustrations, 49 in full color plus a discography. Chapters: � The Gabrielis &amp; the 16th century � Monteverdi &amp; the 17th century � Vivaldi &amp; the 18th century � Grand opera &amp; the 19th century � Contemporary Music &amp; the 20th century</p><p>This lavishly illustrated volume is a spinoff from a five-part series on British television. Its impetus is superficially appealing: the story of musical life in Venice for each of the last five centuries. Unfortunately, apart from the glorious achievements of several individuals--the Gabrielis, Monteverdi, and Vivaldi, for example--there really isn't much to tell, which results in a great deal of "padding." Much of the text avoids musical discussion in favor of celebrating the city itself. The numerous illustrations are often tangential to the matter at hand, and the layout is replete with distracting "factoids" in the margins.

Dale Steadman licked his lips and searched the close Carolina night. Across the street beckoned the last remaining bar from Wilmington's bad old days, a Barbary Coast dive whose music thumped in time to his own lurching heart. Gas lamps flickered and mocked him with shadows that threatened to reveal Erin coming from both directions at the same time. When she finally appeared, dancing across the bricks and waving excitedly, Dale could not even raise his arm in response. He watched heads turn up and down the street, some because of her poise and beauty, others because they recognized the newly arrived celebrity. Dale accepted her kiss of greeting, followed her into the restaurant, and knew a strong man's terror at watching the world slip utterly out of control.<br><br>The Wilmington harbor area had known its share of hard times. Two decades earlier, the streets fronting the Cape Fear River had been home to some of the raunchiest dives this side of Trinidad. Back then, even sailors off the rusting bulk carriers had walked in pairs. Eight Front Street was a product of recent renovation, with French cuisine served in a pre-Revolutionary War warehouse. The waiters liked to thrill the tourists with tales of former nude bar dancers and the three Hudson Bay outlaws who had carved each other up with bone-handled scimitars. But tonight the candles and the gas wall lamps glowed like ghosts of the here and now, and Dale found scant room for bygone days. Across from him, Erin showed a vulnerable enchantment that was all her own, a waif in Hermes silks. As the waiter took their orders, Dale wondered anew why this world-renowned opera diva had ever come to marry him. Or how he had ever let her go.<br><br>They talked of her recent roles at La Scala and Vienna's famed opera house. Candles brushed her features with featherstrokes of youth, as though she were forever seventeen. Erin had been born in Germany and raised in Belgium. That night her accent was an erotic purr. They talked of his recent appointment as chairman of the New Horizons board. They cast those special looks across the table. They pretended she had never abandoned him, leaving for a role in Paris and never coming back. At least, she pretended it had not happened, and he pretended to let it go.<br><br>Erin was an odd mixture of softness and edges. Her nose was far too strong, a single line drawn from forehead to tip. At a certain angle she hearkened back to a distant age of hunter-gatherers, which was perhaps the source of her ruthless intent. Whatever she needed to dispatch, she did so without a solitary hint of remorse. She ate what she killed. And she murdered with grace and song.<br><br>Erin carried a childlike zest about her. She ate with a gusto that was her trademark in everything and brought the burning to his gut once more. She responded with the rounding of her dark eyes, still open to his signals and reading them before they were ever fully formed. After ten and a half months of hellish pain, an hour back in her company was enough to chain him once more.<br><br>She drank sparingly, but encouraged Dale to go the distance. She had always professed to love his drinking and his cigars and his hunting, calling them manly traits in an emasculated world. He was a winner and a giant among pygmies, she had often said, compliments he had always loved to hear from her lips, for the words had usually triggered nights of astonishing passion. Erin had been the first ever to release him from the prison of restraint. The one and only.<br><br>The first difficult moment came as they were finishing the main course. She tossed out the question with a casual glance at other tables, little more than an aside. "Who is keeping you company these days?"<br><br>He was saved by what in earlier times had been a constant barb, but now was a windfall. An older couple approached with pen and smiles outstretched. They had seen her recent PBS opera special and read about her in the New York Times. They were thrilled to meet her. Just so delighted. Erin resumed the role of star and signed their pages, then dismissed them as pleasantly and swiftly as only a diva could.<br><br>She turned back to him. "Am I meant to be jealous already?"<br><br>"I don't want to spend our time talking about this, Erin."<br><br>"No. Of course not. My prim and proper husband dislikes any hint--"<br><br>"Erin. Please."<br><br>She lifted her wine and drained it. She had scarcely tasted it before then. She did not ever drink very much. The dreams came after that, and the terrors. He knew the dreams, but he could only guess at the reasons. Which made her adolescent beauty even more remarkable. Not even having a child had diminished her lissome radiance. It was only in moments like this, when her features tightened in anger or distress, that she aged from a perpetual seventeen to her actual thirty.<br><br>Erin's dark eyes did not so much focus upon him as take aim. "My glass is empty."<br><br>"Sorry." He refilled hers, then his own. "Congratulations on your recent success, by the way."<br><br>"A smooth change of subject. Very smooth."<br><br>"Not to mention the front page of the Sunday Times Arts and Leisure section. Quite a coup."<br><br>Three years ago, Erin had come to New York hoping for a chance to make it at the Met, the crown of America's operatic world. They had met her first week in New York and his second, two outcasts to the Apple's high society. The magnetism was mutual and instantaneous. Or so he liked to think.<br><br>Entry into the New York Metropolitan Opera had never come for Erin. She had hammered upon the backstage entrance with all her might. She had paid her dues by singing every American venue that would have her, from San Francisco to Miami to Chicago. She had gained accolades from virtually every place. But still the Met did not grant the invitation she so desperately craved.<br><br>Dale had followed whenever and wherever he could. Theirs had been an international romance, a fairy tale that fit well into the European magazines. Pictorial spreads appeared in France and Switzerland and Belgium, where opera stars were granted the same status as the Hollywood imports. Beauty and the Beast, was how the German magazine Bild put it, a backwoods hick from a town redolent of slave labor and brown lung. Dale disliked admitting it even to himself, but he had occasionally asked himself the same question. Why had this woman, who could have had almost any man in the entire world, ever married the likes of him?<br><br>Now she was back in Europe. His love had not been enough to keep her content. This was only the second time she had returned to America since their divorce. The other occasion had been to record a PBS special as the precious innocent in Carmen. The telecast had received to-die-for publicity when the New York Times had blasted the Met's new lead conductor for refusing Erin a debut. As a result of the Times' coverage, PBS had gained the largest audience for a televised opera in history.<br><br>Dale had not even known she was in the country until he read of the upcoming broadcast. He had gotten so spectacularly drunk the third act remained a scotch-scented blur.<br>After a two-bottle dinner they had a couple of brandies, or at least he did. Erin sipped twice from her glass, then poured the remainder into his own and said, "Tell me about the break-in at the house."<br><br>"You can't still be reading the Wilmington rag."<br><br>"My press agent has instructions to pass over anything she can find about you. Local man foils armed robbers by knocking them both cold, wasn't that how they put it? Front page above the fold." Erin toyed with the lay of her pearls and the spaghetti strap of her dress. She sounded almost shy. "Perhaps I shouldn't keep such close tabs on you, but I couldn't help myself."<br><br>"I was terrified. But only after it was over. Before there wasn't time for thought."<br><br>Her smile flickered in the candlelight, ephemeral as myth. "Did you really knock them both out?"<br><br>Dale related the bare bones because she seemed so interested, even though the episode still gave him severe night sweats. Apparently he had caught the pair just after they had broken into the house, for nothing had been touched. Erin leaned across the table and pressed him for more. Her intensity caused the afternoon to become vivid once more. He had come home early to discover the nanny bound and gagged on the kitchen floor. Dale had then spotted the two men upon the landing by the baby's room, which was why he went utterly berserk. He had grabbed a nearby lamp, catapulted up the stairs, and taken them both down. Only afterward had he seen their guns. But it would not have mattered anyway. The bigger of the two men had been gripping Celeste's doorknob with his gloved hand. The memory still drenched his vision with blood and fear.<br><br>Erin reached across and snagged his hand and scratched the surface with one fingernail. Back and forth, the proprietary gesture of a woman in comfortable possession of her man. "Let's go back for a nightcap."<br><br>He wanted to say it probably wasn't a good idea. But the light in her eyes kindled a volcano of hurt and craving in his gut. Dale could not deny her. It was his greatest failing. That and the knowledge she could control him only because he still wanted so badly to believe.<br><br>Erin drove, as was their habit when he had been drinking. She rested one hand upon his seatback, where she could play with a wayward curl of his hair. Their careful silence saved him from confessing how time had become a blunt weapon that crashed against the walls of his life, shattering and homicidal.<br><br>When they turned off the state road and entered the tree-draped darkness, she came as close as she ever had to probing his wounds.

Ramachandran, through his research into brain damage, has discovered that the brain is continually organising itself in response to change. A woman maintains that her left arm is not paralysed, a young man loses his right arm in a motorcycle accident, yet he continues to feel a phantom arm with vivid sensation of movement. In a series of experiments using nothing more than Q-tips and dribbles of warm water the young man helped Ramachandran discover how the brain is remapped after injury. Ramachandran believes that cases such as these illustrate fundamental principles of how the human brain operates. The brain &#39;needs to create a &#34;script&#34; or a story to make sense of the world, a unified and internally consistent belief system&#39;. Ramachandran&#39;s radical new approach will have far-reaching effects.</p><p>What would <i>you</i> say about a woman who, despite stroke-induced paralysis crippling the entire left side of her body, insists that she is whole and strong--who even sees her left hand reach out to grasp objects? Freud called it "denial"; neurologists call it "anosognosia." However it may be labeled, this phenomenon and others like it allow us peeks into other mental worlds and afford us considerable insight into our own. <p> The writings of Oliver Sacks and others have shown us that we can learn much about ourselves by looking closely at the deficits shown by people with neurological problems. V.S. Ramachandran has seen countless patients suffering from anosognosia, phantom limb pain, blindsight, and other disorders, and he brings a remarkable mixture of clinical intuition and research savvy to bear on their problems. He is one of the few scientists who are able and willing to explore the personal, subjective ramifications of his work; he rehumanizes an often too-sterile field and captures the spirit of wonder so essential for true discovery. <i>Phantoms in the Brain</i> is equal parts medical mystery, scientific adventure, and philosophical speculation; Ramachandran's writing is smart, caring, and very, very funny.</p><p> Whether you're curious about the workings of the brain, interested in alternatives to expensive, high-tech science (much of Ramachandran's research is done with materials found around the home), or simply want a fresh perspective on the nature of human consciousness, you'll find satisfaction with <i>Phantoms in the Brain</i>. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Dr Vilayanur Ramachandran is professor of Neuroscience and Psychology at UC San Diego. He is a leader in the field of brain research. He has published over 80 papers, edited a 4-volume Encyclopedia of Human Behavior and has appeared on numerous TV programmes.

Now the adventure continues in this tale of strangers whose lives are destined to be entwined.</p><p>During the turbulent reign of William and Mary, orphaned Eileen Ronley finds herself in a precarious position. She is a virtual prisoner with no means of her own on her father's estate, which is now controlled by a former servant, when a mysterious man comes asking for her father. Neil MacCurrie, a Scottish highland chief, is trying to get back to Scotland and is traveling disguised as a French Huguenot. He'd been told that the remote estate in Warwickshire was a safe house, but instead of being welcomed, he is imprisoned. Eileen realizes that he's not French, but, immensely attracted, she doesn't let on and then helps him to escape when his life is in danger. Neil is equally taken with her, and although he has an agreement to marry elsewhere, a prophecy has proclaimed that his wife will be from the east like Eileen. Many forces conspire to separate the two lovers as history comes alive in this tale of love, greed, and political intrigue. <i>Patty Engelmann</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Written in his own unmistakable voice, this is a frank and fascinating account of a geezer&#39;s life in the music business. Jah Wobble begins by offering the most authentic insider&#39;s account of the beginning of punk rock yet written, but there&#39;s much more to him than that. His is an eventful life, as the celebrated ups - PiL&#39;s The Metal Box, 90s hit &#34;Visions Of You&#34; with Sinead O&#39;Connor - are balanced by major downs - chronic alcoholism and marital breakdown. It begins with an East End childhood in a London barely recovered from the War and ends with Wobble finally turning his back on London. Through the book Wobble tell it like he sees it: his opinions of the great and good from Malcolm Mcclaren to Peter Gabriel to Brian Eno to Iain Sinclair are refreshingly disrespectful. Oh and if you ever wondered how got his name, the answer is here: his teenage pal Sid Vicious gave it to him when he drunkenly slurred Wobble&#39;s real name, John Wardle.</p><p>Jah Wobble was born John Wardle in Stepney, East London in 1958. He was one of the founder members of Public Image Limited, along with John Lydon, formerly of the Sex Pistols, whom Wobble met, along with Sid Vicious, at sixth form college. After Wobble left the band he embarked on a number of solo projects and collaborations, including the Invaders of the Heart and the Human Condition. His album Rising Above Bedlam was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize (1992). His latest project, Chinese Dub, is one of the great world music hits of recent years. He is a bass guitarist, singer, composer, poet and music journalist. As well as all that he runs his own record company, 30 Hertz Records. More information at www.30hertzrecords.com.Music Books of the Year: Like his bass, the lows are low and the style upfront. -- Ludovic Hunter-Tilney * Financial Times * Rather than another tale of redemption by a spoiled celeb, this autobiography - articulate, funny and sharply intelligent - reads like a valuable cultural historiography... Jah Wobble has already created one of the most remarkable and idiosyncratic discographies of any musician in Britain during the last 30 years. Memoirs of a Geezer helps to define the questing, sometimes troubled soul behind those legendary low frequencies. -- Alan Warner * Guardian * There isn&#39;t a dull page in this slyly entertaining memoir. Wobble is the ultimate punk and post-punk raconteur and for those not lucky enough to spend time with the great man, this book... is a terrific substitute... [A]n influential and revered bassist... Wobble&#39;s character assessments are always entertaining... -- Suzi Feay * Independent on Sunday * Blackly comic -- Helen Brown * Daily Telegraph * He writes as well as he plays... entertaining and uplifting. -- Tom Widger * Sunday Tribune * An exhilarating journey...he is an agreeable and thoughtful tour guide. -- Tony Russell * Mojo * Riveting account of East End bassist&#39;s life... Wobble&#39;s autobiography is extraordinary: brutally honest, often hilarious, resolutely adhering to his down-to-earth geezer principles but soul-searching and spiritual, with his beloved-but-embattled East End the recurring backdrop. While wit or received wisdom drip from every anecdote, he pulls no punches... Lucid, gripping and incredibly direct, Wobble has produced nothing less than a Cockney Chronicles. -- Kris Needs * Mojo * Sharp, funny and always searingly honest account of his life to date -- Jim Carroll * Irish Times * Post-punk bass behemoth and former London Tube driver bares all... It&#39;s a colourful read, full of the sort of old-school music business shenanigans you hope don&#39;t go on anymore... And Wobble can write... Very entertaining. -- Johnny Davis * Q * Wobble&#39;s writing is punchy and often extremely funny... It&#39;s the terse voice of a man staking out his own territory... the greatest of recent bassists. -- Derek Walmsley * The Wire * A thumpingly good read. * Hot Press * It&#39;s hard not to warm to the candour with which he tracks a life story which has survived alcoholism and endless back-stabbing, to emerge with a healthy perspective on the excesses of a misspent youth... All these years after PiL imploded, anger is still an energy. -- Keith Watson * Metro * [A] diverting tome...Wobble is far too busy to live in the past. -- Martha de Lacey * London Lite * Eminently readable account of the affable East Ender&#39;s journey...perfectly mixes open humility with cavalier swagger. In this engaging dichotomy, Wobble&#39;s personality shines through every anecdote and insight as he matches Devil-may-care visceral grit with cerebral self-analysis... Hilarious, unflinching, self-deprecating... therein lies this particular geezer&#39;s twinkle-eyed, likeably roguish charm. -- Ian Fortnam * Classic Rock * [S]prings off the page the same way a good pub raconteur ambushes you with words... -- David Pollock * The List * There&#39;s plenty to talk about with John Wardle...his honesty and forthrightness is the book&#39;s greatest strength...Wobble is an engaging narrator. -- Joe Shooman * Record Collector * Like you&#39;d expect, gritty and witty recollections from &#34;the nice one&#34; in PiL -- Simon Reynolds * Blissblog * Jah Wobble gives a heartfelt account of himself in Memoirs of a Geezer, a beautifully observed record of much more than his time in the post-punk spotlight with John Lydon&#39;s PiL... -- Simmy Richman * Independent on Sunday * He writes with a punchy honesty and has a good ear for insult...an enjoyable romp through three decades of pop culture as well as an occasional meditation on working-class life and the changing face of London. -- Toby Lichtig * TLS * Passionate, digressive, angry, philosophical and full of (often jet black) humour... If the idea of getting as close as you can to having your ear bent by this talented but awkward customer appeals, you&#39;re likely to find things to enjoy here. -- Jamie Renton * Roots *</p><h2>Maisie Dobbs</h2><p>Young, feisty Maisie Dobbs has recently set herself up as a private detective.

You will be helped as he shares how you, too, can be physically, mentally and emotionally healthy.&#34; -from the foreword by Dr. Neil T. Anderson Depression has become so prevalent that it is known as the &#34;common cold of psychological disorders.&#34; More and more people are suffering from depression, anxiety and panic attacks.

Rather than limit those who seek help, Dr. Grant Mullen advocates a more balanced and comprehensive approach. His book shows you just what emotional bondage is and explains the fundamentals of three treatment paths-medication, deliverance and inner healing.

I have loved the Smiley series since I first read book one, so I was more than apprehensive when I heard Le Carr� was reigniting the storyline with &#x2018;Legacy&#x2019; after so many years (needlessly as it turns out). Peter Guillam, Smiley's most prized assistant, returns with both grace and vengeance as he evaluates life and the lies he has created to survive. Readers don't need to have read the past titles to understand or enjoy &#x2018;Legacy&#x2019;, but I guarantee you will want to go back and start at the beginning as soon as you turn that final page. <em>--Penny Mann</em>John le Carre was born in 1931. His third novel, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, secured him a worldwide reputation, which was consolidated by the acclaim for his trilogy Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, The Honourable Schoolboy and Smiley&#39;s People. His recent novels include A Most Wanted Man, Our Kind of Traitor and A Delicate Truth. His only work of non-fiction, The Pigeon Tunnel, was a Number One bestseller in 2016.</p><h2>A Trial in Venice</h2><p><b>The thrilling conclusion to the #1 national bestselling historical trilogy by Roberta Rich.</b><br><br>In <i>The Midwife of Venice</i>, set in 1575, Hannah Levi was forced to flee Venice with the baby of a Venetian aristocratic family whom she rescued. Roberta Rich followed that action-packed adventure with <i>The Harem Midwife</i>, which exiled Hannah and her beloved husband Isaac to Constantinople--only for Hannah to become enmeshed in the shady politics of a sultan's harem. And now, with <i>A Trial in Venice</i>, set five years later, Hannah is forced back to Venice--both to opulent yet crumbling villas and the Jewish ghetto known as Veneto. Her beloved adopted son Matteo has been kidnapped and is in danger once more. And this time, so is Hannah.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rollicking and evocative read, peopled with beguiling, unforgettable characters (including the epic return of the troublesome and winsome Foscari and Cesca), this novel is a breathtaking follow up to <i>The Midwife of Venice</i> and <i>The Harem Midwife</i>, certain to shock and delight fans of the series and solidify Rich's reputation as one of Canada's most loved historical fiction authors.</p><p>ROBERTA RICH divides her time between Vancouver and Colima, Mexico. She is a former family law lawyer. <i>The Midwife of Venice</i>, her #1 bestselling debut novel, has been published to acclaim in thirteen territories, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany, Spain and Brazil. Her second novel, the nationally bestselling <i>The Harem Midwife</i>, has published in over ten countries.<b>Prologue <br></b><br> <i>Pozzi Prison, </i><br><i> Venice </i><br><i> 1580 </i><br> &nbsp;<br> The walls of her cell wept with moisture.<i> If I could keep dry</i>, thought Hannah, cupping her belly, trying to ignore the wet straw bedding poking through her cotton shift. <br> <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Only the present matters. I am alive. I have kept myself safe for weeks. By the force of my will and the fierce constitution God has blessed me with, my heart continues to beat. I breathe. My head throbs, but it is still attached to my shoulders. My baby moves within me. My strong, courageous baby. If a boy, I shall name him Daniel, who showed such bravery in the lions&#x2019; den. If a girl, I shall name her Esther, in memory of Queen Esther, who saved the Jews from King Xerxes. </i><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rats scurried across her cheek. Her waste bucket had no lid. Daily she heard the tinkle of silver, the rattle of fine china and the pop of wine corks&#x2014;noblemen imprisoned for sodomy or debts, consuming the delicacies they paid the guards to fetch them. From the next cell wafted the stench of gangrenous human flesh and the screams of other prisoners. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unable to endure the wet pallet any longer, Hannah rose and began to clean a wound on her forearm. With the clumsiness of pregnancy, she had fallen and gashed her arm. She poured salt water over it then bound it with the only thing she had: a filthy rag. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guard Guido pressed his pockmarked face, mouth caved in from lack of teeth, to the bars of her cell.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Close to your confinement, are you? How long, do you reckon, till the baby comes?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Guido was no worse than the other guards, but she hadn&#x2019;t the heart to answer, unwilling to acknowledge she would be giving birth to her precious, long-awaited child on a dirty pallet in a prison, surrounded by leering guards, instead of on clean sheets in a bright, airy room at home, comforted by other women and a competent midwife.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah was imprisoned for the most serious of crimes. Had it not been for her belly, the Doge&#x2019;s soldiers would have hanged her soon after they arrested her. If she did not die of the plague or starvation first, she would deliver in the spring&#x2014;scant months away. Once the baby was born, soldiers would drag her from her cell to the <i>strappado</i>. Wrists bound behind her, she would be suspended from a rope thrown over a beam. Weights added to her ankles would intensify the pain, and she would suffer unbearable agony until the breath left her body. Because she was a Jew, she would be quartered, her parts scattered throughout the city. Her baby would be cast into a canal. That is how it was done in Venice.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How distraught Isaac would be if he could see her. If only she could turn into a puff of smoke, drift out the tiny barred window set high in the wall and float back to him. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac. She repeated his name over and over to give herself courage, a caress in this prison of harsh blows on soft backs, of deafening shouts and jeers. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From her linen bag, among a handful of <i>scudi</i>, she fished out the oyster shell button that had once decorated Isaac&#x2019;s shirt. She remembered a warm, sunny day with gulls wheel�ing overhead. She and Isaac had been walking on a beach with Matteo and baby Jessica when they found it. She took it home and with an awl and coping saw fashioned a button out of it. Isaac had laughed with pleasure and said how resourceful she was. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah stroked it against her cheek, taking pleasure in its coolness, its tiny ridges. And then she recalled Isaac&#x2019;s letter and was overcome with a sadness so profound she felt unable to move. What had possessed her to sail across the sea, leaving behind the person who loved her most in the world? She could no longer remember. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This is what she had become: a friendless woman hunched in the corner of a fetid prison cell, back braced against the wall, as she clung to a button. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In spite of Hannah&#x2019;s sleepless nights and poor food, the baby continued to kick her insides energetically&#x2014;staying the executioner&#x2019;s hand. Just as her unborn child protected her, she would protect it, because what is the use of a mother who cannot keep her child alive? And so she forced down the stale bread and thin gruel Guido&#x2019;s wife, the prison cook, provided her. Bianca was gaunt with washed-out blue eyes and the wishbone legs of a woman who had endured too many pregnancies. At night Hannah wrapped herself tightly to prevent rat bites, and avoided prisoners who suffered from coughing fits and infected sores. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thought of her own death frightened her. She would be a fool if it did not. But what gave her no peace, made her stomach clench and her mind restless, was the knowledge she had failed Matteo. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah had risked her life&#x2014;but worse, risked the life of her unborn child. And for what? Matteo might be dead. Strangling a five-year-old would be an easy task. But they needed him, didn&#x2019;t they? <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or would any little red-haired boy serve their purpose just as well? <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1 <br></b><br> <i>Constantinople</i> <br> <i>1579 </i><br> &nbsp;<br> In less time than was needed to recite the Shema, the Jewish morning and evening prayer, they had taken Matteo. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day began like any other. Hannah rose, prepared her son&#x2019;s breakfast of maize soup and a sweet bun, and then kneaded bread dough and placed it in a wooden trough to proof. When she checked the larder, she found there were no carrots to braise in the pan with the Shabbat chicken. She put on her shawl, fastened Matteo&#x2019;s jacket around his stout middle, took him by the hand and headed for the market. He skipped along next to her, his chubby legs pumping to keep up. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She strolled past the vendors at the marketplace until she found the stall where she bought her vegetables. One moment she was haggling over a half-dozen aubergines, Matteo&#x2019;s fingers folded in hers; the next she was racing through packed aisles, knocking over tables laden with fruit, shoving past merchants and housewives, shouting at strangers, &#x201c;Have you seen my son? Red hair? Five years old? Tall for his age? Wearing a blue jacket with a patch of yellow on the sleeve?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hurried to the main road. Perhaps a Gypsy with a dancing bear, or a troupe of acrobats or some other diversion had caught her son&#x2019;s eye and he had elbowed his way into the crowds, exploring as curious boys do. Perhaps an Arab camel caravan. The Arab drivers were often inattentive&#x2014;drunk on date wine, dazed from eating opium or exhausted from months traversing the White Desert. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But the road was empty.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah stopped in the spice market; she paused at the stalls of the apothecaries, their carboys filled with leeches. Shielding her eyes against the sun, she pushed her way to the yoghurt vendor, hoping to find Matteo there, begging for a cup of sheep&#x2019;s yoghurt sweetened with honey. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But there was no small boy among the white-turbaned sellers, no fair-skinned child with a blue jacket among the Gypsies and urchins. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She dodged a worker grunting under a load of bricks and nearly skidded on the entrails of a dead dog. She raced on, sucking for air that would not come, feeling stabs of pain under her ribs. Too many turbaned men pressed into her. Too many veiled women in voluminous skirts blocked her passage. The smells of camel dung, cardamom and rotting fruit overwhelmed her. Shouts of the <i>simit</i> vendors and the colicky cries of donkeys struggling under mountains of fire�wood rang out. Breathless, she slowed her pace. She would go home and return with Isaac. He would know what to do. They would find Matteo together.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah sped back, dizzy and panting so hard she could barely get out the words to her husband. They searched for hours, then days, then weeks, before they were forced to acknowledge what Hannah had known all along: Matteo did not wander off. He did not slip out of her grasp in a moment of excitement to watch a Gypsy leading a dancing bear or a wandering juggler or a fire eater. What she had most feared, from the moment she realized her hand was clasping empty air instead of Matteo&#x2019;s hand, had come to pass. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After all this time, they had returned for him. Hannah was a fool to suppose they had given up.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following several anguished weeks of wakeful nights and tear-filled days, Isaac insisted they get rid of the grey parrot, G�zel. Matteo had not yet mastered the sound of the letter <i>m</i>. Although he could press his lips together with great con�centration and say <i>mmm</i> well, he could not couple the sound with a word. So <i>Mama</i> emerged as &#x201c;Ama.&#x201d; For the pleasure of seeing Hannah burst into tears, the hateful bird would mimic Matteo with cruel clarity, calling from the mulberry tree in the garden, &#x201c;Ama! Ama! Where are you?&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Isaac hauled the parrot off to the market, where he traded the screeching creature to a jeweller from North Africa in exchange for a lapis lazuli necklace for Hannah. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hannah and Isaac set about the task of mourning. At night in bed they held each other and wept, neither saying a word. As the Torah said, &#x201c;The greater the sorrow, the less tongue it hath.&#x201d; But they had no body to wash, no small tombstone in the Jewish cemetery in Hask�y to place a stone on once a year, no one to bring food to their door. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even Jessica, young as she was, grieved for Matteo. She stood next to his bed, patting the blankets, her face con�torted with worry, glaring at Hannah as though her mother were responsible for her brother&#x2019;s disappearance. She would peer under his bed then shout his name the way she did when the two of them played hide-and-seek. &#x201c;Matteo?

Scientists now know that the human brain is undergoing a constant and dramatic transformation in the first years of life. During this peak time of development, <i>every</i> activity and experience leaves an indelible mark on your baby&#x2019;s brain, for better or worse. The right kind of stimulation and nutrition will create connections in the brain that promote intelligence and raise IQ. The wrong kinds of activities and foods can stifle intellectual development, destroy brain cells, and leave your child more vulnerable to learning or behavior problems down the road. So, what can you do during the first five years to ensure that your child is primed to excel?<br><br>The good news is that raising a smarter child is easier than you think. It doesn&#x2019;t require making an investment in expensive equipment or high priced tutors. It&#x2019;s as simple as playing the right games, serving the right foods, and maintaining a brain-enhancing environment in your home by eliminating common household toxins. In <i>Raise a Smarter Child by Kindergarten </i>by Dr. David Perlmutter, you&#x2019;ll learn easy and highly effective strategies that can vastly improve your child&#x2019;s brain power and reduce his or her chances of developing ADD and ADHD. For example, you can:<br><br>� <b>Stimulate Memory:</b> Changing a component on the over-the-crib mobile every week makes the baby compare what was there before to what&#x2019;s there now, reinforcing memory pathways in the brain that are critical for learning.<br><br>� <b>Spread out those shots</b>: Schedule more frequent trips to the pediatrician for vaccinations, so that fewer shots are administered at once. Flooding the immune system with a cocktail of different vaccines can damage the nervous system. <br><br>� <b>Get rid of toxins: </b>Protecting a child from neurotoxins found in foods, toys and even baby bottles can help preserve precious IQ points. <br><br>Dr. Perlmutter provides a scientifically backed food and supplement plan for children and nursing mothers and details the many brain-building activities that you can do with your child. In addition, he reveals the numerous toys and household products that contain harmful, brain-damaging toxins and shows how to identify and combat common childhood problems like ADD and food allergies that may affect your child&#x2019;s development. <br><br>Your job over the first five years is to help your child build the best brain possible. With Dr. Perlmutter&#x2019;s help, you can mine the countless opportunities you have each day to make your child smarter, happier and better prepared to excel.</p><p>Board-certified neurologist DAVID PERLMUTTER, M.D., is the author of <i>The Better Brain Book</i>. A recipient of the Linus Pauling Award, Dr. Perlmutter has appeared widely on television (CNN, <i>Today</i>, Fox News) and as a speaker. He lives in Naples, Florida.CHAPTER ONE<br><br>The Smart Advantage<br>What does it take to raise a smarter child? What must parents do during the first five years of life to ensure that their child is primed to excel in school and in life?<br><br>The good news is, raising a smarter child is easier than you think. It doesn't require making an investment in expensive equipment or high-priced tutors. Nor do you have to devote every waking minute to demanding academic drills. There are easy (and I do mean easy) yet highly effective strategies that can vastly improve your child's brain power. It's as simple as playing the right games with your child, putting the right food on your child's plate, maintaining a brain-enhancing environment in your home, and last but not least, giving your child lots of love.<br><br>I'm a neurologist, a physician who specializes in disorders of the brain and nervous system. At my offices at the Perlmutter Health Center in Naples, Florida, I have worked with both children and adults for more than twenty years. I am also a father of two teenage children. Over the past five years, there have been incredible breakthroughs in the field of neurosciences--particularly in the area of early childhood development--that have given us a new understanding of how the brain develops.<br><br>Science now tells us that the human brain is unfinished at birth. There's a brief window of opportunity in a child's life when parents can help create a brain that is built for optimal performance. Your child's future depends on how well you do that job. If you do your job well, you will raise a smarter child who will fulfill his or her full intellectual potential.<br><br>When I was in medical school, the prevailing scientific view was that the brain you are born with is your brain for life. This belief has now been refuted. New and more effective imaging techniques have provided a window into the brain that has enabled us to see how the brain changes throughout our lifetime. We now know that the human brain is undergoing a constant and dramatic transformation from birth until about age 5 and, to a lesser extent, throughout our entire lives. The brain can be shaped and molded well into adulthood and even into old age, but the most important work is done in early childhood. And that's when parents can make the biggest impact on the lives of their children.<br><br>During the peak time of brain development, <i>every</i> activity and experience leaves an indelible mark on your baby's brain, for better or worse. The right kind of stimulation will create connections in the brain that promote intelligence and emotional stability. The wrong kind of stimulation--or lack of stimulation--can stifle intellectual development, destroy brain cells, and leave your child more vulnerable to learning or behavior problems down the road.<br><br>Some of you may be thinking: Isn't intelligence largely determined by genetics? Won't smart parents automatically have smart children? And if that's true, what can you do about your child's genes? We now know that for the most part, great brains are made, they are not born. From birth to age 3, up to 30 IQ points are up for grabs. Children may be born with the genetic potential to have a higher than average IQ, but if they are not properly nurtured and nourished during the first few years of life, they will not achieve their full potential. What parents do--or fail to do--can win or lose IQ points.<br>DON'T LET YOUR CHILD MISS OUT<br><br>Lots of well-meaning parents are missing key opportunities to enhance their children's intellectual and emotional well-being, not because they are derelict in their duties, but because they are not fully informed.<br><br>There are simple ways you can make your child smarter and make sure that those precious IQ points don't go down the drain.<br><br>� Breast-feeding your baby for the first twelve months of life can boost her IQ by up to 8 points. If you can't breast-feed or have to stop early, be sure to use a commercial infant formula that is fortified with brain-boosting nutrients.<br><br>� Feed your toddler an optimal diet to enhance brain growth. Even a slight deficiency in a key vitamin, mineral, or nutrient (such as iron or iodine) during the time when the brain is going through its spectacular growth spurt can result in a lower IQ, poor test scores, depression, and even teen drug abuse down the road.<br><br>� Engage your baby in mentally stimulating activities from the first few weeks of life through her entire childhood. The right games and activities can improve her memory, boost her mental capacity, and hone her critical thinking skills.<br><br>� Limit the amount of time your child spends watching TV and DVDs and playing video games. Excess time spent watching TV and playing video games during early childhood adds up to poor grades at school.<br><br>� Introduce your child to formal musical training by age 4. It will make him a stronger math and science student.<br><br>� Early training on a computer can improve your child's cognitive function and better prepare him for school.<br><br>� Protect your child from common brain toxins found in food, toys, clothing, and even your own backyard that can cause learning problems and rob her of IQ points.<br><br>� Raise your child in a warm, loving, low-stress environment with attentive caregivers.<br>Every choice a parent makes, from what to feed a child, to how much TV a child watches, to the choice of caregiver can profoundly affect a child's brain growth and development. And so much of your child's brain development is under your control.<br>SO WHAT ABOUT GENETICS?<br><br>And of course, there's a child's genetic makeup, which he gets from you, his parents. Genetics does play an important role in creating a smart brain, but not necessarily in the way that you would expect. And this is probably going to really surprise many of you--we now know that you actually have far more control over your genes than was once believed.<br><br>A healthy baby is born with the raw material to make a great brain, but there's still a lot of work to be done. The newborn brain has 100 billion brain cells (called neurons), but they are unable to communicate with each other very well. During the first one thousand days of life, neurons must learn to talk to each other by forming the vital connections--the neural "pathways to success"--that provide the foundation for language, vision, hearing, learning, feeling, and thinking. Enhancing these connections can spell the difference between a good brain and a great brain. A smart brain is hardwired to think, learn, process, and retrieve information quickly and efficiently. It's true that many of the processes of brain development are gene dependent, but it's also true that we have a great deal of say over how those genes behave.<br><br>It was once believed that if a child was lucky enough to have smart parents, he would inherit smart genes and be born with a great brain. Of course, it doesn't always work that way in real life because as we've now learned, there's so much more to this story than just pure genetics. Environment as well as genetics plays an important role in intelligence and future academic success. Babies who are loved, well nurtured, and well nourished grow up to be adults with higher IQs compared to babies who were not as well cared for. What we didn't fully appreciate in the past was the relationship between genes and environment, or more specifically, how it was possible for environment to affect genes, and therefore IQ.<br><br>We now have a much better understanding of the interrelationship between genes and the environment. Genes may determine the number and quality of brain cells you are born with, but environmental influences over which you as a parent have control turn on and off the very genes involved in brain development. More importantly, we now know that under the right circumstances, it is possible to turn on the right genes, the genes that will make a brain smarter. And I mean this literally.<br><br>Genes do their work by directing the production of proteins that are critical for brain development. These special proteins regulate the wiring between brain cells that ultimately makes the brain smarter, and they are especially important during this period of peak brain development. But what controls the smart genes in the first place? Lots of things, including regular mental stimulation, physical activity, the right foods and nutrients, and the experience of feeling loved and emotionally secure.<br><br>We also know that a negative environment can turn on bad genes and/or prevent good genes from being activated. Children who are fed a less than optimal diet, not raised in a mentally stimulating environment, exposed to dangerous chemicals in the environment, or raised in a stressful household are not as likely to achieve their full intellectual potential as children raised under better conditions.<br>WHAT ARE BRAIN-BUILDING ACTIVITIES?<br><br>Brain-building activities are those that challenge the brain, thereby stimulating the neurons to make more connections, which will make the brain stronger, faster, more efficient, and ultimately smarter. The point of these activities is to train the brain how to think, not what to think. It's about building up the brain's capacity so that your child will be better able to process and utilize information for her entire life. The right kind of stimulation at this pivotal time will create an optimal brain, one that will give your child better tools to perform well in the classroom.<br><br>The achievable goal during this critical window of opportunity is to create the fastest, most efficient, and highest-capacity brain, setting the stage for future success. Much as we all strive for the fastest computer with the most storage capacity, you can achieve the same results with your child's brain. Again, the goal is not to overwhelm your child's brain with as ma...</p><h2>The Austin Seven Source Book</h2><p>Originally published in 1989, this comprehensive reference describes all 329 known Austin Seven variants.

The car was progressively modified, including designing and making adjustable suspension components, machining grooved and drilled brake discs, building his own engines and gearboxes. Purves only entered local clubman rallies as the car was also used as daily transport. His interest in Minis developed into a part time tuning business, in conjunction with his brother. They then built a formula Mini Seven race-car that Purves eventually wrote off while racing at Cadwell Park. The following ten years were spent racing national and international 100cc Karts. A family oriented break ensued.

The Superfluous Men is an anthology of the best, most provocative writings of some of America&#39;s most perceptive social and literary critics, including: Albert J. Nock, H. L. Mencken, Irving Babbitt, Allen Tate, George Santayana, Walter Lippmann, Donald Davidson, Paul Elmer More, and John Crowe Ransom - making The Superfluous Men a valuable introduction to an important thread in the tapestry of American history.</p><p>The roots of modern conservatism as an intellectual and political movement have been explored extensively by a variety of writers, but almost all attention has been focused on ideas and events following the Second World War. Editor Robert M. Crunden seeks to go deeper, in this anthology of prewar material. He brings together a group of authors bound by what one of them calls a concern over "the spiritual disorder of modern life--its destruction of human integrity and its lack of purpose." Contributors include academics, polemicists, and journalists: Irving Babbit, Walter Lippmann, H.L. Mencken, Albert Jay Nock, John Crowe Ransom, George Santayana, Allen Tate, and others. These "superfluous men" (the odd term is derived from Nock's influential book <i>Memoirs of a Superfluous Man</i>) did not consider themselves part of an inchoate conservatism, although a number of them were allied in the New Humanist and Southern agrarian movements. And although they write from decades long past, their voices rarely seem distant. Here is Donald Davidson with an antimaterialist critique of industrial progress (as personified by Henry Ford) that could apply to the roaring economy at the turn of the 21st century: <blockquote>[The masses] must spend and spend unceasingly, in order to consume the never-ending stream of new products that industry hurls upon them. They will be encouraged to make a necessity of every luxury that the clever industrialists may devise. For the industry of the Ford type has not regard for actual or fundamental needs! It seeks to create two or even twenty demands where none at all existed before.</blockquote> Serious students of conservatism will surely want to have a copy of <i>The Superfluous Men</i> on their shelves, near Russell Kirk's <i>The Conservative Mind</i> and George M. Nash's <i>The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America</i>. <i>--John J. Miller</i>&#34;You can&#39;t understand the history of American thought without this critically important volume.&#34;--John Podhoretz &#34;Here is the first generation of American conservative intellectuals, in all their uncomfortable glory: prickly, quirky, unclubbably aristocratic and as individual as the idiosyncratic philosophies they espoused. Compassionate conservatives they most definitely weren&#39;t, and their angry anti-modernism has not yet lost its power to startle and provoke. For those short-sighted youngsters who think conservatism started with Ronald Reagan or Barry Goldwater--or even Bill Buckley--this admirably edited collection will supply a swift kick in the preconceptions.&#34;--Terry Teachout</p><h2>Basic Perspective</h2><p>Bases technical explanations of the principles of perspective, calling upon the mechanics of visual perception</p><p></p><h2>End of an era: Letters and journals of Sir Alan Lascelles, 1887-1920</h2><p>Fast Shipping from Amazon Warehouse.

But once Edgar Rice Burroughs (1875-1950) found his calling, it took him barely six months to produce one of the most enduring characters in popular culture. Tarzan of the Apes was a smash hit all around--in the pulp magazine where he first appeared, in book form, and eventually in a series of movies. As in his previous book about "America's Cowboy Artist" Charles M. Russell, Texas-based journalist Taliaferro displays a healthy appreciation for the work of a mass entertainer without making exaggerated claims for its artistic merits. The biographer also knowledgeably describes the publishing environment in which Burroughs operated, showing how the managerial skills the author acquired in a long string of boring jobs helped him squeeze every nickel out of his literary creations. This all-American moxie linked Chicago-born Burroughs to his readers, who also shared his fascination with exotic places (from Africa to Mars), heroes distinguished by brawn and brains, and heroines as scantily clad as possible. While the text capably chronicles Burroughs's personal affairs, Taliaferro sensibly keeps his focus on the fascinating role the Tarzan creator played in our collective fantasy life and in the development of commercial culture. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>When Tarzan of the Apes was published in The All-Story in 1912, Edgar Rice Burroughs was just another would-be writer struggling to support himself and his family by penning adventure stories for readers of "the pulps, " the cheap mass-market magazines popular at the time. When he died in 1950, he was the bestselling author of the twentieth century, overseeing interests that spanned publishing, movies, radio, newspaper syndication, toys, even real estate. He had millions of enthusiastic readers around the world and had earned the respect of magazines that never published his stories: The Saturday Evening Post admitted of Burroughs's writing, "There are pages of his books which have the authentic flash of storytelling genius." He was, in short, a publishing wonder who had unexpectedly created the century's first superhero, Tarzan -- a popculture icon that has known few rivals.<p>In Tarzan Forever: The Life of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Creator of Tarzan, John Taliaferro vividly recounts the remarkable life and career of the originator of Tarzan. Drawn extensively from Burroughs's own correspondence, memos, and manuscripts, Taliaferro's richly detailed narrative reveals how Burroughs, a down-on-his-luck Chicago pencil-sharpener salesman, first wrote about his most famous character, how he grasped the appeal of this "feral god, " and how he spent the rest of his life nurturing and protecting it. Burroughs, Taliaferro explains, was a pioneer of synergy: His cross-promotional and marketing efforts helped sustain Tarzan's popularity for decades and increased Burroughs's readership far beyond North America. In the course of his career, Burroughs wrote scores of other books and stories, includingwesterns and adventures set on Mars, Venus, and at the Earth's core. In an attempt to graduate from the pulps, he made several stabs at the modern genre of social realism, though inevitably his editors and fans drove him back to his tried-and-true -- more Tarzan tales. Even today, a half-century after Burroughs's death, the character of Tarzan thrives; the arrival of Disney's animated Tarzan is only the latest manifestation.</p><p>Important as Tarzan was to Burroughs, Taliaferro makes clear that Burroughs's life was at least as colorful as the life of his jungle creation. Burroughs was a cavalryman in the Arizona Territory, a cowboy in Idaho, a speculator in Southern California real estate, a Hollywood producer, a witness to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and even a war correspondent in the South Pacific. Unlike Tarzan, though, Burroughs was far from the ideal balance of nature and nurture. He failed at two marriages, and despite the enormous popularity of his books and MGM's Tarzan movies of the thirties and forties, his lavish appetites forever pushed him to the brink of bankruptcy. Shaky finances ultimately drove him to develop his beloved California ranch, Tarzana, into the town of Tarzana, a Los Angeles suburb that today stands as the antithesis of Tarzan's African paradise. Quick to speak out on the controversial issues of his day, Burroughs wrote essays and stories advocating eugenics, the extermination of "moral imbeciles, " and the deportation of Japanese-Americans during World War II.</p><p>In Tarzan Forever, Taliaferro captures all of Burroughs's gifts and flaws, his contradictions and complexities. The result is a deeply satisfying look at one of the architects of today's popularculture.</p></p><h2>Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists Criminals &amp; Other Foreign Menaces to Our Shores</h2><p>Malkin exposes how America continues to welcome terrorists, criminal aliens, foreign murderers, torturers, and the rest of the world&#39;s undesirables.</p><p>Michelle Malkin is a nationally syndicated columnist for Creators Syndicate.

He seemed nice enough when he asked for my number&#x2014;nice enough to share a pizza with on a Tuesday evening after work, anyway&#x2014;but now, watching him hunched over the table, number-crunching, I&#x2019;m fast realizing I&#x2019;ve made a mistake.<br><br>&#x201c;. . . an extra seven dollars and seventy-five cents, and that includes tax and tip,&#x201d; he declares triumphantly, and shows me the screen to prove it.<br><br>A very big mistake.<br><br>0<br><br>To be honest, I blame Mr. Darcy.<br><br>I was just twelve years old when I first read Pride and Prejudice and I fell for him right from the start.

Devastatingly handsome, mysterious, smoldering, and a total romantic, he set the bar for all my future boyfriends.

I&#x2019;m not Ren�e Zellweger. I don&#x2019;t need a man to complete me. I have a career, I pay my own rent, I have a set of power tools and I know how to use them. And as for the other thing, well, that&#x2019;s what battery-operated toys were invented for.<br><br>I hand John the seventy-five cents. Then watch in disbelief as he proceeds to count it.<br><br>Still, that doesn&#x2019;t stop me hankering after a bit of that good old-fashioned romance I&#x2019;m always reading about in books. Or daydreaming about meeting someone who could sweep me off my Uggs and set my pulse racing. A dark, handsome, faithful man, with impeccable manners, brooding good-looks, witty conversation, and one of those big, broad, manly chests you can rest your head upon . . .<br><br>Instead, in the last twelve months, I&#x2019;ve been on one disastrous date after another. Now, OK, I know everyone has a bad-date story to tell. It&#x2019;s completely normal. Who hasn&#x2019;t been out with Creepy Guy/Mr. Nothing in Common With/The Forty-Something Fuck-Up (delete as applicable, or in my case, don&#x2019;t delete any of them)? It&#x2019;s just part of being single. It has to happen once. And twice is bad luck. But a whole string of them?<br><br>For example, here are a few off the top of my head:<br><br>1.Bart had &#x201c;issues with intimacy.&#x201d; Translated, this meant he wouldn&#x2019;t hold my hand as it was &#x201c;too intimate,&#x201d; but it was perfectly OK to ask me back to his place to watch a porn movie on our first date.<br><br>2.Aaron wore white cowboy boots. Which is bad enough. But after canceling on me at the last minute, telling me that he had to work late, I spotted the boots glowing in the darkness of the movie theater that night. Scroll up and there was Aaron in the back row with his tongue down another girl&#x2019;s throat.<br><br>3.Then there was Daniel, the nice Jewish banker who invited me over for a home-cooked dinner. Unfortunately, he &#x201c;forgot&#x201d; to tell me it was his mother doing the cooking. Sorry, did I say mother? I mean, smother. Five courses and three hours of listening to how fabulous Daniel was later, I managed to escape before she got out the baby photos.<br><br>4.And now there&#x2019;s John, otherwise known as Mr. Chivalrous . . .<br><br>&#x201c;So, how about we do this again?&#x201d; he&#x2019;s asking me now as we&#x2019;re leaving the restaurant.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh&#x2014;&#x201d; I open my mouth to reply but instead give a muffled yelp as John lets the door swing back in my face. I just manage to stop it with my elbow. Not that he notices&#x2014;he&#x2019;s already on the sidewalk lighting up a cigarette.<br><br>Rubbing my bruised elbow, I join him outside. After the warmth of the restaurant the cold hits me immediately. It&#x2019;s December in New York and it&#x2019;s way below zero.<br><br>&#x201c;What are you doing Friday?&#x201d; he persists, raising his eyebrows and taking a drag of his cigarette.<br><br>Oh, hell, what do I say now?<br><br>I falter. Come on, Emily. You&#x2019;re both adults. It will be fine. Just be honest and tell him.<br><br>Tell him what? pipes up a little voice inside me. That you&#x2019;d rather stick pins in your eyeballs than go on another date with him?<br><br>&#x201c;Um, well, actually&#x2014;&#x201d; I say in a constricted voice and then stop mid-sentence as he blows smoke in my face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kind of busy,&#x201d; I splutter.<br><br>Busy being too busy to go out with a complete dickhead like you, pipes up that voice again. Only this time it&#x2019;s yelling.<br><br>&#x201c;Too many parties, huh?&#x201d;<br><br>Trust me, I so want to be honest. Why let him off the hook with an excuse? Why protect his feelings? What about those of the next poor, unsuspecting girl he&#x2019;s going to date? It&#x2019;s my duty to tell him. I mean, not only is he cheap and rude, but he has hair plugs.<br><br>That&#x2019;s right. Hair plugs.<br><br>I glance at them now. Under the streetlamp you can see the neat little rows dotted across his shiny scalp. Tiny seedlings of hair planted in a desperate attempt to disguise his receding hairline. Despite my feelings, sympathy tugs. Oh, c&#x2019;mon, don&#x2019;t be so mean, Emily. He deserves understanding and kindness, not judgment and derision.<br><br>Swallowing my annoyance, I force a smile. &#x201c;Yeah, &#x2019;fraid so.&#x201d; I nod, rolling my eyes in a &#x201c;Phew, I&#x2019;m exhausted from all this crazy partying&#x201d; kind of way. Honestly, I could be an Academy Award&#x2013; winning actress, not the manager of a quirky little bookstore in SoHo.<br><br>In truth I&#x2019;ve been to one party. It was at the Orthodontists&#x2019; Society and I had a cold. I spent the whole evening popping Sudafed and discussing my cross-bite, and I was in bed by nine-thirty. The excitement nearly killed me.<br><br>&#x201c;But it was nice meeting you,&#x201d; I add warmly.<br><br>&#x201c;You too.&#x201d;<br><br>John appears to visibly relax and I feel a warm, virtuous glow envelop me. See. Look what a difference a few kind words can have. Now I feel really good about myself. Saint Emily. Hmm, it&#x2019;s got quite a ring to it.<br><br>Buoyed up by my success, I continue: &#x201c;And the plugs are amazing.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Plugs?&#x201d; John looks at me blankly.<br><br>Shit. Did I really just say that?<br><br>&#x201c;Er . . . I meant to say pizza. The pizza was amazing.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m flustered, blushing beet-red and trying not to look at his hairline, which of course my eyes are now drawn to with some kind of magnetic force.<br><br>Argghh. Look away, Emily. Look away.<br><br>There&#x2019;s an excruciating pause. We both try to pretend we&#x2019;re not aware of it. Me by picking my cuticles. Him by surreptitiously patting his hair and checking out his reflection in the restaurant window when he thinks I&#x2019;m not looking. Guilt overwhelms me. Now I feel like a really bad person. Maybe I should apologize. Maybe I should&#x2014;<br><br>In one seamless move, John takes a final drag of his cigarette, grinds it out under his foot, and lunges for me.<br><br>Oh, God. This isn&#x2019;t happening. This can&#x2019;t be happening.<br><br>It&#x2019;s happening.<br><br>For a split second I freeze. Everything seems to go into slow motion. I watch him looming toward me, eyes closed, mouth open, tongue sticking out, and realize he&#x2019;s misinterpreted kindness for a come-on. Fortunately (or should that be unfortunately?), I&#x2019;ve been on enough bad dates in the last year to keep my reflexes sharp, and at the last moment I come to and manage to swerve just in time.<br><br>His lips crash-land on the side of my face and he plants a sloppy kiss on my ear. Eugghhh. I pull away sharply. Even so, it&#x2019;s a bit of a struggle as he has his hand wrapped around my waist like a vice.<br><br>We spring apart and face each other on the sidewalk.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, in that case, I think I&#x2019;ll grab a cab home,&#x201d; he says curtly, stuffing his hands into the pockets of his pleated pants.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, me too,&#x201d; I reply shakily, wiping my spit-soaked ear with my sleeve.<br><br>Silence. We both stand at the curb trying to hail a cab. Finally, after a painful few minutes, I see the familiar sight of a yellow cab with its light on. It pulls up and I heave a sigh of relief and reach for the door handle, but John beats me to it. I&#x2019;m pleasantly surprised. At last! A bit of chivalry.<br><br>Heartened, I soften and throw him my first real smile of the evening as he tugs open the door. Perhaps I&#x2019;ve misjudged him. Perhaps he&#x2019;s not so bad after all.<br><br>Without hesitation, he jumps inside and slams the door.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, thanks for a great evening,&#x201d; he says, sticking his head out the window. &#x201c;Happy Holidays!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; I yell, suddenly finding my voice. &#x201c;Hey, you&#x2019;ve stolen my&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>But the cab takes off down the street with a screeching of tires.<br><br>Abandoned on the slushy sidewalk, I watch the taillights disappear into the traffic and, despite my anger, I suddenly feel myself crumple inside. Unexpectedly my eyes prick with tears and I blink them back furiously. Honestly, what&#x2019;s gotten into me? I&#x2019;m being ridiculous. The man was a total moron. I&#x2019;m not upset. I&#x2019;m fine, totally fine. And sniffing determinedly, I stuff my hands in my pockets and head off in the direction of the subway.<br><br>&#x201c;You should have called the cops.&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s the next morning and I&#x2019;m at work at McKenzie&#x2019;s, a small, family-owned bookstore, where I&#x2019;m the manager. I look up at Stella, my assistant, who&#x2019;s standing on a stepladder stacking books.<br><br>&#x201c;Why? For stealing the first cab?&#x201d; Smiling resignedly, I pass her more titles. &#x201c;Please, Officer, my date stole the first cab. He&#x2019;s not a gentleman. Arrest him.&#x201d;</p><h2>An American Type: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>The author of the greatest American immigrant novel, <em>Call It Sleep</em>, returns with this posthumous work.</strong></p> Henry Roth&#x2019;s final novel, <em>An American Type</em>, is nothing short of a miracle, a lyrical work of immense poignancy from a writer whose biographical story has no parallel in American literature. Roth, best known for his towering immigrant novel <em>Call It Sleep</em>, emerged from a literary hibernation of 60 years in 1994 with Mercy of a Rude Stream, a fictional quartet that would be hailed by as &#x201c;a landmark of the American literary century.&#x201d; In contrast to Roth&#x2019;s previous novels, <em>An American Type</em> is a both a love story and a lamentation, the final fruit of nearly 2,000 unpublished pages that Roth composed in the last years of his life. The manuscript rested undisturbed in an office file for over a decade before it was sent to Willing Davidson, then a young assistant in the Fiction Department of <em>The New Yorker</em>, who with a &#x201c;growing sense of discovery and elation,&#x201d; recognized that this unpublished manuscript possessed &#x201c;astonishing vigor.&#x201d;<br><br> Set in the dire year of 1938, the novel reintroduces us to Roth&#x2019;s alter-ego, Ira Stigman, a 32-year-old novelist, eager to assimilate but psychologically traumatized by the scars of his impoverished immigrant past. Restless with his older lover and literary mentor, the renowned English professor, Edith Welles, whose obsessive love has crippled him, Ira, a &#x201c;slum-born Yiddle,&#x201d; journeys to Yaddo, the famed writer&#x2019;s colony, where he meets a blond, aristocratic pianist, whose inherent nobility and &#x201c;calm, Anglo-Saxon radiance&#x201d; engages him.<br><br> The ensuing romantic crisis, as well as the conflict between his ghetto Jewish roots and the bourgeois comforts of Manhattan, forces Ira to abandon the comforts of his paramour&#x2019;s Greenwich Village apartment. In his relentless search to become a writer, a husband and an American, Ira heads West with an illiterate, boorish Communist, on an illusory quest for the promise of the American West. Thumbing rides from gruff truckers, riding the rails with hobos through the Dust Bowl, Ira explores America&#x2019;s inherent splendors and its Depression tragedies as he returns home, uncertain if he will marry M., questioning if he&#x2019;ll ever be able to make anything of his lapidary prose.<br><br> Set against crumbling piers and glimmering skyscrapers in Manhattan, against seedy motor courts and tufted palm trees in sun-soaked Los Angeles, <em>An American Type</em> is not only, perhaps, the last first-hand testament of the Depression, but also a universal statement about the constant reinvention of American identity, and, with its lyrical ending, the transcendence of love. 3 photos</p><p>Discovered in a stack of nearly 2,000 unpublished pages by a young <em>New Yorker</em> editor, this is the final novel by Henry Roth, whose <em>Call It Sleep</em> was published in 1934 and who &#x201c;staged the literary comeback of the century&#x201d; <em>(Vanity Fair</em>) with <em>Mercy of a Rude Stream</em> in 1994. Set in 1938, <em>An American Type</em> reintroduces us to Roth&#x2019;s alter ego, Ira, who abandons his controlling lover, Edith, in favor of a blond, aristocratic pianist at Yaddo. The ensuing conflict between his Jewish ghetto roots and his high-flown, writerly aspirations forces Ira, temporarily, to abandon his family for the sun-soaked promise of the American West. Fast-paced but wrenching, set against a backdrop of crumbling piers, bedbug-infested SROs, and skyscrapers in glimmering Manhattan and seedy L.A., <em>An American Type</em> is not only, perhaps, the last firsthand testament of the Depression but also a universal statement about the constant reinvention of American identity and, with its lyrical ending, the transcendence of love. This posthumous work was edited by Willing Davidson, a fiction editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.<p><strong>Henry Roth</strong> (1906&#x2013;1995) spent his early years on Manhattan&#x2019;s Lower East Side. In 1914, the Roth family moved to Jewish Harlem.

But Rose discovers the truth the day she picks up the newspaper at Pickens General Store and spies a group photograph captioned The Southwestern Scourge of 1915! There stands Abe alongside none other than Pancho Villa and his army! <br><br>Rose is furious about Abe's lie; fearful for his safety; and worried about her traditional parents who, despite their strict and observant ways, do not deserve to have an outlaw for a son. Rose knows the only way to set things right is to get Abe home, but her clandestine plan to contact him goes awry when she is kidnapped by Villa's revolutionaries and taken to his hideaway. <br> Deep in the desert, amidst a richly rendered assortment of freedom-seekers that includes an impassioned young reporter, two sharp-shooting sisters with a secret past, and Dorotea, Villa's tyrannical young charge, Rose sees no sign of Abe and has no hope of release. But as she learns to lie, hide, and ride like a bandit, Rose discovers the real meaning of freedom and what she's willing to risk to get hers back. <br><br><b>A Sydney Taylor Honor book</b> <br><b>A National Jewish Book Award finalist</b></p><p>Susan Krawitz is a freelance writer and editor. Viva, Rose! won the Sydney Taylor Manuscript Award for a middle grade novel. The story is partly based on her family&#39;s stories of a cousin who rode with Pancho Villa during the Mexican Revolution. She lives in New York.Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Rose and her family are Russian Jewish immigrants living in El Paso, TX, in the early 1900s. Rose discovers that one of her older brothers, Abraham, has lied to their parents concerning his whereabouts and has joined Pancho Villa's army. While trying to have a letter delivered to Abe telling him to give up his outlaw ways and come home, Rose is kidnapped by some of Villa's soldiers and taken to their camp. There she becomes the playmate/servant of a young and very spoiled girl named Dorotea. Rose finds her brother and tries to convince him to leave with her. The book is filled with danger and suspense. It also contains a lot of history about Pancho Villa and how he fought for the poor of Mexico. The characters of Rose and Dorotea are the most well developed; Rose is quite mature for a 13-year-old. Her first-person narrative is delivered in a straightforward voice with very little emotion, which often doesn't do justice to the harrowing events in the story.

In a seamless, sweeping narrative, <em>Lords of the Sky</em> tells the extraordinary stories behind the most famous fighter planes and the brave and daring heroes who made them legend. </p><p>In the Great War, aces such as Manfred von Richthofen ("The Red Baron"), Eddie Rickenbacker, and Roland Garros faced horrific survival rates and became romantic heroes. The Second World War saw the RAF locked in a struggle for the fate of civilization during the Battle of Britain; on the Eastern Front, the German Luftwaffe and Soviet Air Force grappled in some of the fiercest and bloodiest air battles in history. In the Pacific, Japanese pilots terrorized Asia, culminating in their attack on Pearl Harbor. American flyboys quickly became instrumental to the Allies' ultimate victory, ravaging the enemy's navy, providing life-saving air support for ground troops, escorting bombers, and dogfighting with Japanese Zeros and Nazi Messerschmitts. During the Cold War, conflicts in Korea and Vietnam featured the dawn of the jet age, in which American pilots battled Soviet-made MiGs and increasingly sophisticated anti-aircraft weaponry. Hampton then draws on his own experience as an F-16 pilot who fought in the 1991 and 2003 wars against Iraq to bring to life the dangers and demands of today's modern fighter pilot.</p><p>Here are the stories behind history's most iconic aircraft and the aviators who piloted them: from the Sopwith Camel and Fokker Triplane to the Mitsubishi Zero, Supermarine Spitfire, Nazi Bf 109, P-51 Mustang, Grumman Hellcat, F-4 Phantom, F-105 Thunderchief, F-16 Falcon, F/A-18 SuperHornet, and beyond.

A history buff since early childhood, expensively educated at university a history major, no less! he s reached middle age with a third-grader s grasp of early America. In fact, he s mislaid more than a century of American history, the period separating Columbus s landing in 1492 from the arrival of English colonists at Jamestown in 160-something. Did nothing happen in between?<br><br>Horwitz decides to find out, and in <i>A Voyage Long and Strange</i> he uncovers the neglected story of America s founding by Europeans. He begins a thousand years ago, with the Vikings, and then tells the dramatic tale of conquistadors, castaways, French voyageurs, Moorish slaves, and many others who roamed and rampaged across <i>half</i> the states of the present-day U.S. continent, long before the <i>Mayflower</i> landed.<br> <br>To explore this history and its legacy in the present, Horwitz embarks on an epic quest of his own trekking in search of grape-rich Vinland, Ponce de Le�n s Fountain of Youth, Coronado s Cities of Gold, Walter Raleigh s Lost Colonists, and other mysteries of early America. And everywhere he goes, Horwitz probes the revealing gap between fact and legend, between what we enshrine and what we forget. <br><br>An irresistible blend of history, myth, and misadventure, <i>A Voyage Long and Strange</i> allows us to rediscover the New World for ourselves.</p><p>Tony Horwitz, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting for the Wall Street Journal, is the author of CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC, BAGHDAD WITHOUT A MAP, ONE FOR THE ROAD and INTO THE BLUE, a New York Times bestseller.

In December 1620, they reached Plymouth, a place &#x201c;fit for situation,&#x201d; Bradford wrote. &#x201c;At least it was the best they could find.&#x201d;</p><p>On a New England road trip a few summers ago, I washed up in Plymouth, too. It could have been Dedham or Braintree or some other pit stop on the highway near Boston. But a Red Sox game pulsed on the radio, so I drove until it ended at the Plymouth exit. Stopping for beer at Myles Standish Liquor, I was directed to the William Bradford Motor Inn, the best I could find in peak tourist season.</p><p>Early the next morning I went for a walk along the waterfront, past a chowder house, a saltwater taffy shop, a wax museum, and a replica Mayflower moored in the bay. Near the water stood a gray historic marker that was terse even by New England standards.</p><p>Plymouth Rock. Landing Place of the Pilgrims. 1620.</p><p>I looked around and couldn&#x2019;t see anything except asphalt and a few stones small enough for skipping. Then I spotted a lone speed-walker racing down the sidewalk. &#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; I said, chasing after him, &#x201c;but where&#x2019;s Plymouth Rock?&#x201d;</p><p>Without breaking stride, he thrust a thumb over his shoulder. &#x201c;You just passed it.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty yards back was a columned enclosure, between the sidewalk and shoreline. Stepping inside, I came to a rail overlooking a shallow pit. At the bottom sat a lump of granite, the wet sand around it strewn with cigarette butts and ticket stubs from the wax museum. The boulder, about five feet square, had a badly mended cleft in the middle. It looked like a fossilized potato.</p><p>A few minutes later a family arrived. As they entered the portico, the father intoned to his children, &#x201c;This is where it all began.&#x201d; Then they peered over the rail.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Guess so.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s, like, nothing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got rocks bigger than that in our yard.&#x201d;</p><p>Before long, the portico was packed: tour bus groups, foreign sightseers, summer campers. Their response followed the same arc, from solemnity to shock to hilarity. But Plymouth Rock was an icon of American history. So visitors dutifully snapped pictures or pointed video cameras down at the static granite.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s going to be one heckuva home movie.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. My Visit to Plymouth Pebble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Pilgrims must have had small feet.&#x201d;</p><p>I went over to chat with a woman in green shorts and tan shirt standing outside the enclosure, counting visitors with a hand clicker. Claire Olsen was a veteran park ranger at Plymouth, accustomed to hearing tourists abuse the sacred stone. &#x201c;A lot of people come here expecting the Rock of Gibraltar,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s where they went on their last vacation.&#x201d;</p><p>She was also accustomed to fielding odd questions. Was it true that the Mayflower crashed into Plymouth Rock? Did the Pilgrims serve Thanksgiving on top of it? The bronze, ten-foot-tall Indian on a hill overlooking the rock&#x2014;was he life-sized?</p><p>The most common question, though, concerned the date etched into the rock&#x2019;s surface. Why did it say 1620, visitors wondered, rather than 1492? Wasn&#x2019;t that when Columbus arrived?</p><p>&#x201c;Or they ask, &#x2018;Is this where the three ships landed?&#x2019;&#x201d; Claire said. &#x201c;They mean the Ni�a, the Pinta, and the Santa Mar�a. People think Columbus dropped off the Pilgrims and sailed home.&#x201d;</p><p>Claire had to patiently explain that Columbus&#x2019;s landing and the Pilgrims&#x2019; arrival occurred a thousand miles and 128 years apart. &#x201c;Americans learn about 1492 and 1620 as kids and that&#x2019;s all they remember as adults,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The rest of the story is blank.&#x201d;</p><p>As she returned to counting tourists, I returned to the Governor Bradford, chuckling over visitors&#x2019; questions. America, great land of idiocy! But Claire&#x2019;s parting comment gave me pause. Back on the road, winding past cranberry bogs, I scanned the data stored in my own brain about America&#x2019;s founding by Europeans. In fourteen hundred and ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue... John Smith and Jamestown... the Mayflower Compact... Pilgrims in funny hats... Of the Indians who met the English, I of course knew Pocahontas, Squanto, and... Hiawatha?</p><p>That was the sum of what I dredged up. Scraps from elementary school and the Thanksgiving table. Plus some fuzzy, picture-book images of black-robed friars and armored conquistadors I couldn&#x2019;t identify. As for dates, I&#x2019;d mislaid an entire century, the one separating Columbus&#x2019;s sail in 1492 from Jamestown&#x2019;s founding in 16-0-something. Maybe nothing happened in the period between. Still, it was distressing not to know. Expensively educated at a private school and university&#x2014;a history major, no less!&#x2014;I&#x2019;d matriculated to middle age with a third grader&#x2019;s grasp of early America.</p><p>Returning home to Virginia, I resolved to undertake some remedial study. At first, this proved deceptively easy: most of what I wanted to know was hiding in plain sight, at my local library. After skimming a few histories, I dug deeper, reading the letters and journals of early explorers. A cinch, really&#x2014;except, an awful lot happened between Columbus and the Pilgrims. Incredible stories I&#x2019;d known nothing about. This wasn&#x2019;t a gap in my education; it was a chasm.</p><p>By the time the first English settled, other Europeans had already reached half of the forty-eight states that today make up the continental United States. One of the earliest arrivals was Giovanni da Verrazzano, who toured the Eastern Seaboard in 1524, almost a full century before the Pilgrims arrived. Verrazzano, an Italian in command of a French ship, smelled America before he saw it: &#x201c;A sweet fragrance,&#x201d; he wrote, wafted out to sea from the dense cedar forests of the Carolinas.</p><p>Reaching the coast, Verrazzano dispatched one of his men to swim ashore and greet some people gathered on the dunes. The natives promptly carried the Frenchman to a fire on the beach and stripped off his clothes&#x2014;not to &#x201c;roast him for food,&#x201d; as his shipmates feared, but to warm the sailor while &#x201c;looking at the whiteness of his flesh and examining him from head to toe.&#x201d;</p><p>Coasting north, Verrazzano was favorably impressed by a wide bay he called Santa Margarita, better known today as New York harbor. &#x201c;A very agreeable place,&#x201d; he wrote, presciently observing that its well-populated shore &#x201c;was not without some properties of value.&#x201d; Only at the end of his east coast cruise was Verrazzano disappointed. Natives bared their buttocks at sailors and lowered trade goods onto &#x201c;rocks where the breakers were most violent.&#x201d; Verrazzano called this &#x201c;Land of Bad People,&#x201d; a name since changed to Maine.</p><p>In 1528, on a return voyage to America, Verrazzano went ashore on a Caribbean island that appeared deserted. He was quickly seized by natives, then &#x201c;cut into pieces and eaten down to the smallest bone.&#x201d; Or so claims the only surviving account of his landing, which concludes: &#x201c;Such a sad death had the seeker of new lands.&#x201d;</p><p>History has been cruel to Verrazzano, too. In his own time, the navigator was so renowned that his name appeared on an early globe, spanning the east coast of North America. Today, he is forgotten, except as the namesake of a New York bridge that arcs over the narrows he sailed through in 1524.</p><p>Even less remembered are the Portuguese pilots who steered Spanish ships along both coasts of the continent in the sixteenth century, probing upriver to Bangor, Maine, and all the way to Oregon. En route, in 1542, one diarist wrote of California, &#x201c;The country appears to be very fine,&#x201d; but its inhabitants &#x201c;live very swinishly.&#x201d; That same year, Spanish conquistadors completed a reconnaissance of the continent&#x2019;s interior: scaling the Appalachians, rafting the Mississippi, peering down the Grand Canyon, and galloping as far inland as central Kansas (much to the surprise of the Plains Indians, who had never seen horses).</p><p>The Spanish didn&#x2019;t just explore: they settled, from the Rio Grande to the Atlantic. Upon founding St. Augustine, the first permanent European city on U.S. soil, the Spanish gave thanks and dined with Indians&#x2014;fifty-six years before the Pilgrim Thanksgiving at Plymouth. The Spanish also established a Jesuit mission in Virginia, a few miles from the future Jamestown. Nor were Spaniards the only Europeans on the premises. French Protestants, fleeing persecution at home, founded a Florida colony in 1564, before all but two of the Pilgrims were born.</p><p>The more I read about pre-Mayflower America, the more I wondered why I&#x2019;d learned so little of it before. This wasn&#x2019;t a clot of esoteric names and dates I&#x2019;d dozed through in high school history, like the Habsburg Succession or the War of Jenkins&#x2019;s Ear. This was the forgotten first chapter of my own country&#x2019;s founding by Europeans, a chapter mysteriously redacted from the textbooks of my youth&#x2014;and, as far as I knew, from national memory.</p><p>Anglo bias seemed the obvious culprit, but it didn&#x2019;t altogether explain Americans&#x2019; amnesia. Jamestown preceded Plymouth by thirteen years as the first permanent English colony on the continent. Yet, like most Americans, I was ignorant of the Jamestown story, even though I&#x2019;d spent much of my life in Virginia. Almost everyone knows the Mayflower, even new immigrants; the Pilgrim ship features prominently in citizenship tests. How many Americans can name the three ships that brought the first English to...</p></p><h2>Little House, Little Town</h2><p>Simple, lyrical text and engaging illustrations take preschoolers on a tour of life for a young family living in a cozy house in a lovely little town and the many people they meet while traveling through town.</p><p>Scott Beck creates wonderful worlds in his timeless picture books.

Scott is a fabric designer, father of two, and the author-illustrator of two highly praised picture books for young children. He lives in Montclair, New Jersey.PreS&#x2013;In this cheerful glimpse at small-town life, a baby wakes up and begins an ordinary day filled with pleasant moments. Slowly, like a movie camera, the narrator's omniscient view pulls back, taking readers outside, where boys ride bikes, a neighbor hangs out laundry, and the people of the community begin to go about their business. Baby reappears in a stroller, going for a walk with his parents. As the day lengthens, the residents wind up their activities and head for home. Darkness falls, and Daddy rocks his son to sleep, gently putting him down "in his little crib, in their little house, in the little town." This sweet story told in rhyme is accompanied by simple acrylic illustrations. Filled with smiling townsfolk, the pictures convey warmth and contentment, and effectively move the story along.

The book does not break new ground, despite its aspirations, but it's well worth a look. Among the best stories: Peter Straub's "Blue Rose," about a disturbed youth whose violence finds its inevitable expression in the insanity of Vietnam; Joe Haldeman's account of another Viet vet, "The Monster," whose ability to adopt different personalities gets out of control in a spectacular manner; George Clayton Johnson's "The Man with a Hoe," a tale of the worm turning, with a vengeance; Ramsey Campbell's almost unbearably claustrophobic chiller of a traveling book salesman who wanders into a particularly loathsome Hell; Charles L. Grant's "Out There," which tells of a man who has drawn the web of his life so tightly it cuts him when he tries to break free; and Clive Barker's horror-detective story, "Lost Souls," an unusually restrained tale for this author.

The list of contributors is formidable: Peter Straub, Ramsey Campbell, Charles L. Grant, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and others. The focus is not on possessed children, demonic mass murderers, or terrors from beyond the grave, but instead on the breakdown of the mind or soul, the darker side of sexuality, and other internal horrors. The stories range from the traditional to the avant-garde; some are sexually explicit; all are noteworthy. An exciting and satisfying collection that could well mark a turning point for the genre, this is recommended for all contemporary fiction collections.

The names of its principal characters, Peewee Kirkland, New Child Lynch, and Mark Lawrence, are real. I have changed the names of others for reasons that will become obvious.<p>I do not venture in this telling far afield of the events of the lives remarked here. You, no doubt, would have puzzled out the reasons for this narrowness of compass on your own. Sometimes, very old, very broad stories are best told small, in consumable units of observed lives, replete with travail and stunted prospect. Social data, the scholar's tool, serve well enough in conveying the trend and breadth of social conditions. But the usefulness of the academician's bar graph ends there, bleaching from general view the searing pain and hopelessness borne by the modern, uncomprehending victims of old, obscure, and oft-transmuted American social policies. To understand the full damage that America has done to the black world over the last 346 years, we must extrapolate the general from the specific, not the other way around.</p><p>The young black men whose stories are told here represent the gravely endangered generation of the fathers of our future. They, like the millions who comprise their peer ranks, were born into the rigged game of dysfunctional families, variably crippling poverty, poor education, and all but nonexistent opportunity for long-term success.</p><p>Some of them miraculously survive; a few, even, like Mark Lawrence and Peewee Kirkland, with an abiding exercise of fatherlike duty towards the many like New Child Lynch who are forced to contend with social obstacles that no child in a "civilized" society should ever be compelled to confront.</p><p>Such are the legacies for American blacks after 246 years of slavery and the century of government-embraced racial discrimination that followed on slavery's heels. One hundred and thirty-eight years after the Emancipation Proclamation, our young men, slavery's grandsons, are six times more likely to be arrested for a serious crime than are their white counterparts. After arrest, they are more likely than their white counterparts to be prosecuted and convicted. Upon conviction, they serve prison sentences roughly twice as long as those served by whites for the same crimes.</p><p>From birth, black inner-city males are strapped onto a hard-life treadmill leading all too often toward early death or jail. While the United States has the highest incarceration rate of any nation in the world, Washington, D.C., the nation's capital, has one of the highest in America. More than one in every three black men in the District of Columbia between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five falls under one or another arm of the criminal justice system.</p><p>Prisons, increasingly under private ownership, are a growth industry. Nothing inflates prison stock prices like the growing ranks of American prisoners, the majority of whom are being held for nonviolent crimes and, all too many, in places like Washington, D.C., well past the times set by the courts.</p><p>Public funds are being used to subsidize a national private prison industry whose growth depends on higher incarceration rates. Said differently, society is subsidizing its own demise for the benefit of private investors. The investors are disproportionately white. The prisoners are disproportionately black. Inside the new private hells, prisoners toil for private companies, earning but a pittance while undercutting the wages of nonprison labor. Owing to the extremely low wages for prison labor, the companies that employ prisoners constitute, not surprisingly, still another new growth industry. Towards this modern bondage, down this human cattle chute, black males from birth are being herded willy-nilly before our very eyes. It is this new de facto slavery that benefits the same private interests, transmogrified, that its predecessor institution benefited centuries before.</p><p>In my last book, The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks, I argued that only massive American government reparations can begin to repair the devastating economic and psychosocial injury done to blacks in America since 1619 at the hands of, first, the colonial governments, and, later, the American government. But while broad programmatic restitution can insure for African-Americans a future, it cannot salvage a living generation of African-American men and women who are being, in alarming numbers, lost to the black community as wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, breadwinners, and responsible social contributors.</p><p>This, we must do for ourselves.<br></p></p><h2>Composition (Eyewitness Art)</h2><p>Explains ever type of composition throughout art history, from geometrical shapes to asymmetry, perspective, and the ideal of the &#34;golden section,&#34; and demonstrates how composition has influenced artist decisions for tone, color, and light. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>In this excellent book, London-based contemporary art critic Kent sets out to explain composition?why and how painters divide up the surfaces of their pictures?by looking closely at specific masterpieces. Her very effective selections include well-known works by masters such as Manet, Gainsborough, and Picasso. To describe and illustrate ideas like perspective, color, and narrative, she naturally leans more heavily on representational traditions, but the final few pages of her short book do address more recent experiments with abstraction. Kent's captions are deftly written, and she articulately explains both the conceptual and tangible elements contained within a four-sided work of art. Like previous titles in Dorling Kindersley's extremely useful series (e.g., Sculpture, LJ 11/15/94), Kent's is geared toward the beginning student of painting or art history, and it's easy to imagine this book serving as an invaluable supplementary text for a first-year art history course. Despite its brevity, Composition goes far beyond the desultory treatment that this topic receives in most histories of art. Highly recommended for all collections.?Douglas F. Smith, Oakland P.L., Cal.<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.YA?A mini-course in art appreciation. By presenting the basic elements and applications of composition, Kent explains how paintings are viewed, and how the artist arranges the work for best representation. Balance, perspective, design, symmetry, horizon, sequence, light, color, and the other aspects of composition are described in a lucid text that delineates the features of individual paintings. Over 70 Western masterpieces are displayed with analyses of the artists' techniques. Readers are drawn along the splendid pageant of art history from the 15th-20th centuries by examples of innovations introduced by painters from da Vinci to Picasso. Each picture features a separate aspect of composition, which is interpreted for viewers. While the glossary doesn't cover all terms used in the text, the definitions provided are quite sufficient. The material is so attractively and clearly presented that this is a "must purchase" for any collection.?Catherine Noonan, Fairfax County Public Library, VA<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Flight Of The Maidens</h2><p>Flight of the Maidens</p><p></p><h2>Dialogue and Drama: Elements of Greek Tragedy in the Fourth Gospel</h2><p>Over the past century, academics and dramatists have noted that the Gospel of John displays similar characteristics to Greek dramatic literature. <i>Dialogue and Drama </i>presents a detailed and nuanced review from Jo-Ann Brant, a scholar well versed in the study of both Greek tragedy and the New Testament. She argues that the fourth evangelist was thoroughly familiar with the conventions of Greek drama and used them to more effectively present the Gospel's plot.<br><br>As in Greek tragedy, dialogue is the major form of action. The hero, Jesus, engages in verbal duels with his opponents in order to provoke a lethal contest, which culminates in his glorious death. <i>Dialogue and Drama</i> creates an accessible world for the audience and makes them witnesses of the tragedy, drawing readers into a corporate act of remembering.<br><br>Brant casts fresh perspective on the roles of the Jews, Peter, the women around Jesus, and the beloved disciple, proposing an alternative account of the evangelist's dualistic and polemical language and offering new approaches to aspects of the Gospel that have long puzzled readers and dominated scholarly debate. Scholars of literary Biblical criticism and students of drama will find in this text a thorough, engaging, and interdisciplinary study that answers questions left open by prevailing theories and opens new avenues of research yet to be explored.</p><p><b>Jo-Ann A.

The previous edition, published by Parallax Press, won an Anne Izard Storyteller's Choice Award, and the stories have been anthologized in collections such as Soul Food, Best-Loved Stories Told at the National Storytelling Festival, and Peace Tales. Told and developed by Rafe over many years, these stories include legends of the historical Buddha's birth, life, and enlightenment as well as traditional jataka tales?stories of the Buddha in his former births, often appearing in animal form. A section of later tales contains original stories by Rafe, two of which, "Kogi, the Priest" and "Digit," can be heard in told versions on his tapes Ghostly Tales of Japan and Animal Dreaming. In many of these seemingly simple tales, wise animals teach humans important lessons about the central Buddhist principles of wisdom, heroic action, nonviolence and compassion. From the familiar legend of the Buddha's Enlightenment, to the title story of a tenderhearted prince who offers his body to a starving tigress and her cubs, to a twentieth-century tale based on the heroic act of a World War II pilot, these stories are imbued with deep interest in the natural world and empathy for all things living. <p>A complete section of detailed commentaries provides essential background information and analysis of each story. In addition, two thoughtful essays explore the relevance of jataka tales to us today, and how the stories can be used to teach and guide our lives. The book artfully draws together Buddhist scholarship, story-as-teaching, folktales, and myth into what is both an engaging story book and an informative resource, sure to delight and enlighten all readers.</p></p><p>Rafe Martin, a practitioner of Zen Buddhist tradition for more than 25 years, is the author of numerous award-winning books and recordings for children and adults.

But it continues to fascinate, partly because it holds the promise of hours of good reading, and partly because by taking snapshots every 10 years the lists highlight the way the novelist's eye has shifted focus over time. What leaps out of the new list, as the <i>Granta</i> judges have commented, is a heavy emphasis on things foreign... Despite the disparities in their birthplaces and in the settings they chose for their tales, the six writers profiled here out of the 21 agree on one thing: in the last analysis, differences of voice and location are cosmetic; what matters most are the characters they give birth to and the stories they have to tell" - Ed Pilkington, <i>Guardian G2</i><br><br>"In 1996 <i>Granta</i> magazine published its first talent-spotting list of the Young Turks of American Fiction... <i>Granta</i> have run their exercise again, and the results show, again, how compelling and diverse the American scene is... <i>Granta</i> 97, the anthology dedicated to these writers, is a splendid volume" - Stuart Kelly, <i>Scotland on Sunday</i><br><br>"The second <i>Granta</i> list of Best Young American Authors validates the best things about US immigration, vital when so many in Europe have forgotten what a diverse, polyphonic, unmonolithic country it is...

Though almost all the writing is assured, the stories betray a great deal of uncertainty about sex, religion, war and belonging.

But she used this birth-right wisely, and her legacy includes a string of books beloved and admired equally by historians, biographers, and readers. <p>Origo's mother, Lady Sybil Cuffe, married William Bayard Cutting in 1901, and when the family was not traveling to the far corners of the earth, Iris spent her youth in the ancestral estate on Long Island and in her grandfather's castle in Ireland. Her father died tragically when she was eight, and she continued her peripatetic life with her indefatigable mother and beloved governess. A woman who always knew her mind, in 1923 Origo bought La Foce, an entire valley, almost feudal in organization, in the Val d'Orcia of Tuscany. There for fifty years she worked tirelessly with her husband, improving the land and the lot of the peasants, saving endangered children from the brutal incursions of the Nazis, and writing history and memoirs that are still considered classics of the genre. </p><p>Origo was at once a woman of action and introspection, of boundless curiosity and endearing innocence. She wrote beautifully, thoughtfully, and lucidly. As Raymond Mortimer once observed of this book, "A masterly biographer here recounts her own story . . . and in this biography she is at her best." </p><p>"A small classic of autobiography . . . Origo recreates the lost mad wold of Bernard Berenson and the Anglo-American artistic coterie in Florence. She is marvelous at nuances of place and personality, writing with a subtle mingling of candor and affection that lingers in the mind." -- Fiona MacCarthy</p>Without any intention ``to convert, to reveal, or to confess,'' accomplished biographer Origo (The Merchant of Prato, etc.) records her unique memories, first published in England in 1970, of a privileged, intellectual, cosmopolitan life early in this century. Born into an international family, Origo spent her childhood years between her paternal grandparents' estate in Westbrook, Long Island, her maternal grandparents' home in Great Britain, and her mother's villa in Fiesole. Although her father died early, he made sure his daughter grew up devoid of limiting national identity and open to different cultural influences. Her mother instilled a passion for travel and books. While grateful to her family for the comfort and care they provided, Origo portrays certain aspects of her upbringing with restrained criticism. Her proper British mother, for instance, insisted on Origos private education by governesses and tutors, opposed her desire to enroll in university, and committed her to a tasteless, nauseatingly ``healthy'' diet. In hindsight, Origo considers her period of ``coming out'' into high society a considerable waste of time. Readers, however, will appreciate her colorful accounts of balls and theater visits as a glimpse of elite diversions in bygone days. Origo's descriptions of early 20th-century American magnates and patrons of the arts and her detailed reconstruction of Italian landowners' traditional life are among many other engaging passages. Sketching her own character in an irreproachably modest tone, she commands respect for her ability to apply her superb education, knowledge of the world, and financial means to worthy causes. She helped modernize devastated farmland in Tuscany, volunteered in the Red Cross during WWII, and sheltered orphaned children at her home after the war. This active, creative attitude arises out of Origo's profound sense of being ``singularly fortunate,'' despite some personal tragediesa rare and therefore doubly appealing trait. Along with its exquisite style and thought-provoking digressions on the philosophy of writing, this autobiography documents fascinating experiences of the modern European and American aristocracy.

Wiseau&#x2019;s scenes were rivetingly wrong, yet Sestero, hypnotized by such uninhibited acting, thought, &#x201c;I have to do a scene with this guy.&#x201d; That impulse changed both of their lives. Wiseau seemed never to have read the rule book on interpersonal relationships (or the instruc�tions on a bottle of black hair dye), yet he generously offered to put the aspiring actor up in his LA apart�ment. Sestero&#x2019;s nascent acting career first sizzled, then fizzled, resulting in Wiseau&#x2019;s last-second offer to Sestero of costarring with him in <i>The Room</i>, a movie Wiseau wrote and planned to finance, produce, and direct&#x2014;in the parking lot of a Hollywood equipment-rental shop.<br> <br>Wiseau spent $6 million of his own money on his film, but despite the efforts of the disbelieving (and frequently fired) crew and embarrassed (and fre�quently fired) actors, the movie made no sense.

This year I&#x2019;m trying to earn a living.<br> <br>&#x2014;Sunset Boulevard<br> <br>Tommy Wiseau has always been an eccentric dresser, but on a late-summer night in 2002 he was turning the heads of every model, weirdo, transvestite, and face-lift artist in and around Hollywood&#x2019;s Palm Restaurant. People couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at him; I couldn&#x2019;t stop looking at him. Even today, a decade later, I still can&#x2019;t unsee Tommy&#x2019;s outfit: nighttime sunglasses, a dark blazer as loose and baggy as rain gear, sand-colored cargo pants with pockets filled to capacity (was he smuggling potatoes?), a white tank top, clunky Frankenstein combat boots, and two belts. Yes, two belts. The first belt was at home in its loops; the second draped down in back to cup Tommy&#x2019;s backside, which was, he always claimed, the point: &#x201c;It keeps my ass up. Plus it feels good.&#x201d; And then there was Tommy himself: short and muscular; his face as lumpy and white as an abandoned draft of a sculpture; his enormous snow-shovel jaw; his long, thick, impossibly black hair, seemingly dyed in Magic Marker ink&#x2014;and currently sopping wet. Moments before we walked in, Tommy had dumped a bottle of Arrowhead water over his head to keep &#x201c;this poofy stuff&#x201d; from afflicting his considerable curls. He had also refused to let the Palm&#x2019;s valet park his silver SL500 Mercedes-Benz, worried the guy would fart in his seat.<br> <br>At this point I&#x2019;d known Tommy for almost half a decade. Tommy and I looked more like Marvel Comics nemeses than people who could be friends. I was a tall, sandy-blond Northern California kid. Tommy, meanwhile, appeared to have been grown somewhere dark and moist. I knew exactly where Tommy and I fit in among the Palm&#x2019;s mixture of Hollywood sharks, minnows, and tourists. I was twenty-four years old&#x2014;a minnow, like Tommy. That meant we had at least thirty minutes to wait for a table. Upon entering the restaurant, I could see various diners consulting their mental Rolodexes, trying to place Tommy. Gene Simmons after three months in the Gobi Desert? The Hunchback of Notre Dame following corrective surgery? An escaped Muppet? The drummer from Ratt?<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t wait in the line,&#x201d; Tommy said, speaking to me over his shoulder. He marched up to the Palm&#x2019;s hostess. I kept my distance, as I always did at times like this, and waited for the inevitable moment in which Tommy spoke and the person to whom he was speaking tried to make geographical sense of his pronunciation, which sounded like an Eastern European accent that had been hit by a Parisian bus. The hostess asked Tommy if he had a reservation.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have table reservation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s the name?&#x201d; she said, slightly sarcastically, but only slightly, because who knew whether Ratt was on the verge of releasing a Greatest Hits album? Her job required carefully hedging one&#x2019;s fame-related bets.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ron,&#x201d; Tommy said.<br> <br>She checked her list. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; she said, tapping her pencil on the page. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no Ron here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, sorry,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Robert.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked down. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no Robert here, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy laughed. &#x201c;Wait, I remember now. Try John.&#x201d;<br> <br>The hostess found the name John near the bottom of her list.<br> <br>&#x201c;John,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Party of four?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, yes,&#x201d; Tommy said, summoning me over to bring him one party member closer to accuracy.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know who &#x201c;John, party of four&#x201d; actually was, but the hostess snagged a wine menu and began walking us to our table.<br> <br>I followed Tommy and the hostess through the Palm&#x2019;s dim interior and looked at the dozens of movie-star caricatures that lined its walls. There was Jack Nicholson, Bette Davis, O. J. Simpson&#x2014;which made me wonder: What, exactly, did you have to do to get banished from the wall of the Palm? I noticed some starry faces sitting at the tables, too. Well, maybe not starry, but midsize astral phenomena: sports broadcaster Al Michaels, colleague to my beloved John Madden; Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Josie Maran; the cohost on our local ABC News. There were also lots of faces unknown to me but obviously connected. These mostly middle-aged men and women talked show business at conversational levels, and real show business sotto voce. The waiters were all older, beefy guys who smelled of expensive aftershave and had big, white, manicured nails; they were such smooth operators, they almost managed to convince you it didn&#x2019;t matter that you weren&#x2019;t famous. The air in the Palm was very expensive. Everything, other than the food, tasted like money.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Tommy said indignantly, after the hostess showed us to our table. &#x201c;Excuse me but no. I don&#x2019;t sit here. I want booth.&#x201d; Tommy always insisted on a booth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sir, our booths are reserved.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Tommy was nothing if not unrelenting. I think the hostess figured she had two options: Give Tommy a booth or call animal control to tranq him. Through a combination of lying, grandstanding, and bullying, Tommy and I were now seated in a booth in the nicest section of the Palm. As soon as Tommy sat down he flagged someone down and said he was &#x201c;starving&#x201d; and ready to order.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t work here,&#x201d; the person said.<br> <br>Whenever Tommy is in a restaurant, he always orders a glass of hot water. I&#x2019;ve never seen a waiter or waitress do anything but balk at the request.<br> <br>Here&#x2019;s how the Palm&#x2019;s waiter handled it: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Did you say a glass of&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy: &#x201c;Hot water. Yes. This is what I am saying.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A lemon maybe or&#x2014;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look, why you give me hard time? Do I speak Chinese? This is simple request, my God. Are you tipsy or something? And more bread with raisin stuff.&#x201d;<br> <br>We were at the Palm to celebrate. The following morning, official production would begin on The Room, a film Tommy had conceived, written, produced, cast, and was now directing and set to star in. If you&#x2019;d known Tommy as long as I had, the beginning of The Room&#x2019;s production was a miracle of biblical significance. I&#x2019;d worked on the film with him, on and off, since its inception. My most recent and intense job on the film was working as Tommy&#x2019;s line producer. When we began, I had no idea what a line producer was. Neither did Tommy. Basically, I was doing anything that needed to be done. I scheduled all auditions, meetings, and rehearsals; ran the casting sessions; helped find equipment; and, most challenging, made sure Tommy didn&#x2019;t sabotage his own film. In a sense I was his outside-world translator, since no one knew him better than I did. I was also in charge of writing the checks that were flying out the door of Wiseau-Films like doves in search of dry land. For all this, Tommy was paying me a decent wage, plus &#x201c;perks,&#x201d; which was what Tommy called food. With Tommy&#x2019;s vanity project about to begin, my plan was to walk into my eight-dollars-an-hour retail job at French Connection the next day and quit. I hoped never again to fold something I wasn&#x2019;t going to wear myself.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Tommy said, taking off his sunglasses. His eyes were red with veiny lightning. &#x201c;We are in production. How do you feel?&#x201d; He started to wrangle his hair into a scrunchie-secured ponytail.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Tommy was looking at me directly, which didn&#x2019;t happen that often. He was sensitive about his left eyelid, which drooped noticeably, and he rarely held anyone&#x2019;s gaze. When he did talk to someone he&#x2019;d try to hold his face to the left, which he thought was his best angle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you nervous little bit?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For big day tomorrow.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should I be nervous?&#x201d;<br> <br>He shrugged. As we ate, we talked a little more, and things in the Palm started to wind down. Nine p.m. is, however, Tommy&#x2019;s noon, so as the Palm became emptier and more sedate, Tommy grew more and more energetic. I had to get home for a number of reasons, not the least of which was my girlfriend, Amber. She wasn&#x2019;t a fan of Tommy&#x2019;s and hated it when I wasn&#x2019;t with her on her nights off.<br> <br>Tommy leaned forward. He&#x2019;d never touched his hot water. &#x201c;What you think now about The Room?&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;d told Tommy what I thought about The Room several times, which was that the script didn&#x2019;t make any sense. Characters&#x2019; motivations changed from scene to scene, important plot points were raised and then dropped, and all of the dialogue sounded exactly the same, which is to say, it sounded exactly like Tommy&#x2019;s unique understanding of the English language. But nothing I said would ever change his view of The Room, so what did it matter? I thought the film offered a fascinating glimpse into Tommy&#x2019;s life. But I couldn&#x2019;t imagine anyone anywhere would be able to decipher it, let alone pay money to see it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what I think about The Room,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Why are you asking me this now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because tomorrow is very important day. It will go to the history. Touchdown. No one can take away. Our top-of-mountain day! We begin to shoot.&#x201d; He smiled and leaned back. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe this, if you really think about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Congratulations. You deserve it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy looked at me, his face slack. &#x201c;This &#x2018;yeah&#x2019; is not convincing. You are not happy?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was happy. I was also, at that moment, distracted. I&#x2019;d accidentally caught eyes with a young brunette across the restaurant, which I think she mistakenly took as an invitation. She and her blond friend were checking out our table. And now, suddenly, they were coming over. Dressed up, both of them. Heels, both of them. Young, both of them. The blond woman looked like an agent&#x2019;s assistant maybe meeting her slightly racier, less securely employed friend for a night of whatever they felt like they could get away with. They had sparkly eyes and hello-there smiles and were holding half-drunk glasses of wine, which were clearly not their first drinks of the evening.<br> <br>They motioned for Tommy and me to scoot in so they could join us. &#x201c;Just wanted to come over and say hey,&#x201d; the brunette said. &#x201c;Thought you were cute.&#x201d;<br> <br>We awkwardly shook hands, introduced ourselves. Greg. Tommy. Miranda. Sam. Our booth smelled like it had been hit with a precision strike of apples-and-vanilla perfume.<br> <br>Conversation, haltingly, began. Yeah, the food was great. Oh, that&#x2019;s so funny! My bare arm was touched once, twice. Tommy was glowering, backing away into some small, irritated corner of his mind. He stayed there for a bit, before, out of nowhere, he asked the girls, &#x201c;So what do you do besides drink?&#x201d;<br> <br>They exchanged a quick, decisive look. I could almost see the mischief in their eyes flicker out at the same time. &#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d; Miranda said.<br> <br>Tommy sighed. &#x201c;I ask what do you do? Any job or anything? What do you offer besides the vodka?&#x201d;<br> <br>Miranda looked into her wineglass questioningly, and then over at me. There was nothing I could say. Miranda and Sam stood up. Yes. Well. It was nice meeting you, Greg. Yeah, thanks. You, too. We&#x2019;ll see you around. Sure. Take care, then. Absolutely.<br> <br>After they left, I looked at Tommy and shook my head. &#x201c;Girls are crazy,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>The waiter arrived and asked to see Tommy&#x2019;s identification. This wasn&#x2019;t unusual. Our bill was huge, and Tommy was paying with his credit card, which wasn&#x2019;t reading. Tommy, however, refused to show the waiter identification, eventually announcing, &#x201c;I have a right under law of California!&#x201d; Then the waiter made it clear to Tommy that the Los Angeles Police Department was only a phone call away. Tommy got angry and allowed the waiter to glimpse his driver&#x2019;s license beneath a murky plastic lining in his wallet. The waiter said he was sorry, but Tommy had to remove the identification. &#x201c;Very disrespectful!&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry but you are completely off the wall.&#x201d; The waiter, finally, acceded.<br> <br>Tommy stormed out. I lingered behind, apologizing to every member of the staff I saw. I&#x2019;d become accustomed to this; it was how I paid for our dinners.<br> <br>Outside the Palm, we waited for the valet to drive Tommy&#x2019;s Benz around. (He had apparently forgotten about the dangers of valet farting.) I dreaded the look on the valet&#x2019;s face when Tommy tipped him. On a hundred-dollar dinner tab, Tommy would often tip five dollars. Sometimes the recipients of Tommy&#x2019;s tips would come back to him, with an air of wounded dignity, and ask, &#x201c;Have I done something wrong?&#x201d; And Tommy would say, &#x201c;Be happy with what you have.&#x201d; Tommy must have been feeling a little guilty about what went down inside the Palm, because the valet didn&#x2019;t seem scandalized by the tip Tommy gave him.<br> <br>We headed east on Santa Monica. Traffic was light, but Tommy was nevertheless driving at his standard speed of twenty miles below the legal limit. I wondered, sometimes, what drivers on the freeways of Greater Los Angeles thought when they passed Tommy. Expecting to see some centenarian crypt keeper behind the wheel, they instead saw a Cro-Magnon profile, wild black hair, and Blade Runner sunglasses.<br> <br>Coincidentally, at the first stoplight, Miranda and Sam from the Palm pulled up beside us. I looked over and smile-waved. They, of course, burst out laughing. Tommy powered down the passenger window and said, as loud as he could, &#x201c;Ha! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ha! Ha! Ha!&#x201d; Horrified, they pulled away from the stoplight as though from a terrible accident. I sank into my seat. This was another way in which I passed the time in Tommy&#x2019;s company: trying to disappear.<br> <br>Tommy looked over at me and said, &#x201c;You look great, by the way. Like Spartacus.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tommy loved movies, though I wasn&#x2019;t sure he&#x2019;d seen anything made after 1965. I think he thought I looked like Spartacus because for the first time in my life I was wearing a beard. While working on the casting of The Room, which took months longer than it should have, I had let the beard&#x2014;along with my relationship&#x2014;just sort of go. Though Amber hated it, I&#x2019;d grown to like the beard. There was something invigoratingly Viking about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Spartacus?&#x201d; I said. At that point, I had never seen Spartacus, but I gathered Tommy&#x2019;s observation was accurate. A few years later I finally watched it. Spartacus does not have a beard.<br> <br>The car began to roll forward again. &#x201c;So listen now,&#x201d; Tommy said. &#x201c;This is very important. You have to do The Room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am doing The Room.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is not what I mean. I mean you must act in The Room. Perform. You have to play Mark.&#x201d;<br> <br>We&#x2019;d been over this. Many, many times. Tommy claimed that he&#x2019;d written the part of Mark&#x2014;who in the script betrays his best friend, Johnny (Tommy&#x2019;s character), by sleeping with Johnny&#x2019;s future wife, Lisa&#x2014;for me. I was never sure how to take this.<br> <br>In the four years that I&#x2019;d known Tommy, he&#x2019;d come to my aid on numerous occasions. If it weren&#x2019;t for Tommy, I never would have moved to Los Angeles. Now he was making a film&#x2014;a film that meant the world to him. So I was happy to help him. But act in it? That was an entirely different level of obligation. I knew what good films looked like. The Room was not going to be a good film. It was probably going to require divine intervention just for Tommy to finish the thing.<br> <br>This was to say nothing of the fact that the role of Mark had already been cast.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you think about this?&#x201d; Tommy asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I think,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;that Don is already playing Mark.&#x201d; The actor&#x2019;s name was Dan, but Tommy always called him Don, so I had to call him that, too.<br> <br>Tommy was quiet for a block. Gobs of oncoming headlight filled the car and withdrew. We were now traveling ten miles below Tommy&#x2019;s standard twenty miles below the speed limit, all while he veered int...</p><h2>Almost Missed You: A Novel</h2><p><p><b>The sensational debut that <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Garth Stein calls &#x201c;an emotional powerhouse of a novel&#x201d; now in trade paperback.</b></p><p>Violet and Finn were &#x201c;meant to be,&#x201d; said everyone, always.

They have two children.This third book in Harrison's Storyteller trilogy completes the tale begun in her two previous works, <i>Song of the River</i> (1997) and <i>Cry of the Wind</i> (1998). This installment, which, like the others, is set in prehistoric Alaska, features two storytellers: Yikaas, a young, handsome, and fiery-tempered member of the River People tribe; and Qumalix, a beautiful, clever, and high-spirited member of the Sea Hunters tribe. These two quick-witted characters spend their evenings sparring verbally and weaving tales of their historic ancestors for their gathered tribespeople. Their nightly contest to tell the most enchanting tale (and the hint of attraction between them) brings to life legends of the tribes' heroic ancestors, much to the delight of the assembled listeners, while also weaving a dramatic plot for readers to follow. Well-written and meticulously researched, Harrison's powerful yarn details the hardships and simplicity faced by prehistoric people while also emphasizing their humanity. It will appeal not only to Harrison's own fans but also to fans of <i>Clan of the Cave Bear </i>(1980). <i>Kathleen Hughes</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In other words, how the soul - the ideal - reveals itself in astrological terms. In the process, Carter invents a new form of rulerships, based on the traditional exaltations, which includes the outer planets. <p> Carter also teases us with his unpublished system of numerology, which was based on 12, rather than the usual 10. As astrology is based around the numbers 2, 3, 4 and 12 (not 5 or 10), a base-12 number system is of immediate interest. </p><p> Realizing his subject was abstract and unlikely to appeal to all, Carter also includes innovative ideas on directing, and on transits. The result is a book that fascinates on many levels. </p><p> Carter's books, penetrating &amp; full of unique insights, are ideal for intermediate &amp; advanced astrologers. They are, in fact, virtually in a class by themselves. Carter's books are organic wholes. He shows how individual astrological factors combine to create living, breathing people. It is this constant interplay of factors, and Carter's brilliant, lucid exposition, that makes his books so precious.</p></p><p><b>Charles E.O. Carter</b>, one of the leading astrologers of the 20th century, was President of the Astrological Lodge at the Theosophical Society from 1920 to 1952. He was first Principal of the Faculty of Astrological Studies, which he helped found in 1948. He edited The Astrologer's Quarterly from 1926 until 1959. <b>The Zodiac and the Soul</b> was first published in 1928, with revisions in 1947, 1960, and 1968, the year of his death.</p><h2>Beyond The Occult</h2><p>Hoping to prove that the universe of the paranormal is as consistent and comprehensive as that of modern science, Wilson discusses the unseen powers of the human mind, poltergeists, spirit possessions, and reincarnations</p><p>Novelist and mystic Wilson is probably the wrong person to write nonfiction examinations of the occult. The part of the occult that purports to be scientific (e.g., parapsychology) requires the ability to think like a scientist and to evaluate evidence. Instead, Wilson gives many nice anecdotes, all of dubious value scientifically. These he "supports" by offering quotations from fringe scientific sources, never mentioning that most scientists don't accept them. Because there are many popular misinterpretations cited in the bibliography, Wilson's narrow speculations are ultimately built on sand. His work would have been less spectacular, but more deserving of attention, if he had based it more solidly on established facts. He writes well, and may hold the reader's interest, but what he says will do little toward unifying the occult as a serious scientific subject.<br><i>- Gordon Stein, Univ. of Rhode Island</i><br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Wilson ( The Occult ; The Misfits ) maintains that a belief in telepathy and precognition is compatible with science, arguing that mystical and paranormal experiences involve a widening of one's ordinary field of perception. A well-documented synthesis of research into the paranormal, this lively, succinct narrative hops from ESP to mediumship, out-of-body travel, spirit possession, poltergeists, near-death visions and reincarnation. Wilson weaves in the psychic or mystical experiences of Blake, Goethe, Jung, Maupassant, Arthur Koestler, Dylan Thomas, Philip K. Dick, others. He grounds his beliefs in the theory of an "information universe," in which everything that ever happened is somehow on record, and in the view that so-called occult powers are latent in each of us as part of our unfulfilled evolutionary potential. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Information Architects</h2><p>This groundbreaking book, now available in paperback, reports on an explosive new design field: the design of information to improve, clarify, and facilitate processes of communication and learning.<p>As the world responds to a burgeoning information superhighway, the structure and design of data becomes increasingly important.

It also includes a large body of his satiric or humorous occasional verse, much of which is fugitive and little known to the general reader. In addition, the volume provides the text of the surviving prose &#34;Epiphanies, Giacomo Joyce&#34; - the fascinating Trieste notebook that Joyce compiled while finishing &#34;A Portrait of the Artist&#34; and beginning &#34;Ulysses&#34;, in which he first explored the world of his autobiographical novel.</p><p>James Joyce was born in Rathgar, Dublin, in 1882. In 1904 he and Nora Barnacle (whom he married in 1931) left Ireland for Trieste. Abroad, free from the restrictions he felt in Ireland, Joyce felt compelled to write of his native land, producing <i>Dubliners </i>(1914) and <i>A Portrait of the Artist as Young Man</i> (1916). During World War I, he lived in Zurich from 1915 to 1919, and in 1920 moved to Paris, where he spent most of the rest of his life. Towards the end of December 1939 James Joyce and Nora Barnacle left Paris for a small village near Vichy and ultimately settled in Zurich, where he died in January 1941. His major works, pioneering the 'stream of consciousness' style, are the novels <i>Ulysses</i> (1922) and <i>Finnegans Wake</i> (1939).</p><h2>Mountain Rain: a New Biography of James O.

I had no thought of deserting her. It was a series of odd circumstances that put me in the garage attic with all the junk furniture and the raccoon droppings-which is how I began to leave her, all unknowing, of course- whereas I could have walked in the door as I had done every evening after work in the fourteen years and two children of our marriage. Diana would think of her last sight of me, that same morning, when she pulled up to the station and slammed on the brakes, and I got out of the car and, before closing the door, leaned in with a cryptic smile to say good-bye-she would think that I had left her from that moment. In fact, I was ready to let bygones be bygones and, in another fact, I came home the very same evening with every expectation of entering the house that I, we, had bought for the raising of our children. And, to be absolutely honest, I remember I was feeling that kind of blood stir you get in anticipation of sex, because marital arguments had that effect on me.<br><br>Of course, the deep change of heart can come over anyone, and I don't see why, like everything else, it wouldn't be in character. After having lived dutifully by the rules, couldn't a man shaken out of his routine and distracted by a noise in his backyard veer away from one door and into another as the first step in the transformation of his life? And look what I was transformed into-hardly something to satisfy a judgment of normal male perfidy.<br><br>I will say here that at this moment I love Diana more truthfully than ever in our lives together, including the day of our wedding, when she was so incredibly beautiful in white lace with the sun coming down through the stained glass and setting a rainbow choker on her throat.<br><br>On the particular evening I speak of-this thing with the 5:38, when the last car, where I happened to be sitting, did not move off with the rest of the train? Even given the sorry state of the railroads in this country, tell me when that has happened. Every seat taken, and we sat there in the sudden dark and turned to one another for an explanation, as the rest of the train disappeared into the tunnel. It was the bare, fluorescent-lit concrete platform outside that added to the suggestion of imprisonment. Someone laughed, but in a moment several passengers were up and banging on the doors and windows until a man in a uniform came down the ramp and peered in at us with his hands cupped at his temples.<br><br>And then when I do get home, an hour and a half later, I am nearly blinded by the headlights of all the SUVs and taxis waiting at the station: under an unnaturally black sky is this lateral plane of illumination, because, as it turns out, we have a power outage in town.<br><br>Well, it was an entirely unrelated mishap. I knew that, but when you're tired after a long day and trying to get home there's a kind of Doppler effect in the mind, and you think that these disconnects are the trajectory of a collapsing civilization.<br><br>I set out on my walk home. Once the procession of commuter pickups with their flaring headlights had passed, everything was silent and dark-the groomed shops on the main street, the courthouse, the gas stations trimmed with hedges, the Gothic prep school behind the lake. Then I was out of the town center and walking the winding residential streets. My neighborhood was an old section of town, the houses large, mostly Victorian, with dormers and wraparound porches and separate garages that had once been stables. Each house was set off on a knoll or well back from the street, with stands of lean trees dividing the properties-just the sort of old establishment solidity that suited me. But now the entire neighborhood seemed to brim with an exaggerated presence. I was conscious of the arbitrariness of place. Why here rather than somewhere else? A very unsettling, disoriented feeling.<br><br>A flickering candle or the bobbing beam of a flashlight in each window made me think of homes as supplying families with the means of living furtive lives. There was no moon, and under the low cloud cover a brisk unseasonable wind ruffled the old Norwegian maples that lined the street and dropped a fine rain of spring buds on my shoulders and in my hair. I felt this shower as a kind of derision.<br><br>All right, with thoughts like these any man would hurry to his home and hearth. I quickened my pace and would surely have turned up the path and mounted the steps to my porch had I not looked through the driveway gate and seen what I thought was a moving shadow near the garage. So I turned in that direction, my footsteps loud enough on the gravel to scare away whatever it was I had seen, for I supposed it was some animal.<br><br>We lived with animal life. I don't mean just dogs and cats. Deer and rabbits regularly dined on the garden flowers, we had Canada geese, here and there a skunk, the occasional red fox-this time it turned out to be a raccoon. A large one. I have never liked this animal, with its prehensile paws. More than the ape, it has always seemed to me a relative. I lifted my litigation bag as if to throw it and the creature ran behind the garage.<br><br>I went after it; I didn't want it on my property. At the foot of the outdoor stairs leading to the garage attic, it reared, hissing and showing its teeth and waving its forelegs at me. Raccoons are susceptible to rabies and this one looked mad, its eyes glowing, and saliva, like liquid glue, hanging from both sides of its jaw. I picked up a rock and that was enough-the creature ran off into the stand of bamboo that bordered the backyard of our neighbor, Dr. Sondervan, who was a psychiatrist, and a known authority on Down syndrome and other genetic misfortunes.<br><br>And then, of course, upstairs in the attic space over the garage, where we stored every imaginable thing, three raccoon cubs were in residence, and so that was what all the fuss was about. I didn't know how this raccoon family had gotten in there. I saw their eyes first, their several eyes. They whimpered and jumped about on the piled furniture, little ball-like humps in the darkness, until I finally managed to shoo them out the door and down the steps to where their mother would presumably reclaim them.<br><br>I turned on my cell phone to get at least some small light.<br><br>The attic was jammed with rolled-up rugs and bric-a-brac and boxes of college papers, my wife's inherited hope chest, old stereo equipment, a broken-down bureau, discarded board games, her late father's golf clubs, folded-up cribs, and so on. We were a family rich in history, though still young. I felt ridiculously righteous, as if I had fought a battle and reclaimed my kingdom from invaders. But then melancholy took over; there was enough of the past stuffed in here to sadden me, as relics of the past, including photographs, always sadden me.<br><br>Everything was thick with dust. A bull's-eye window at the front did not open and the windows on either side were stuck tight, as if fastened by the cobwebs that clung to their frames. The place badly needed airing. I exerted myself and moved things around and was able then to open the door fully. I stood at the top of the stairs to breathe the fresh air, which is when I noticed candlelight coming through the stand of bamboo between our property and the property behind ours, that same Dr. Sondervan's house. He boarded a number of young patients there. It was part of his experimental approach, not without controversy in his profession, to train them for domestic chores and simple tasks that required their interaction with normal people. I had stood up for Sondervan when some of the neighbors fought his petition to run his little sanatorium, though I have to say that in private it made Diana nervous, as the mother of two young girls, that mentally deficient persons were living next door. Of course, there had never been a bit of trouble.<br><br>I was tired from a long day, that was part of it, but, more likely suffering from some scattered mental state of my own, I groped around till I found the rocking chair with the torn seat that I had always meant to recane, and, in that total darkness and with the light of the candles slow to fade in my mind, I sat down and, though meaning only to rest a moment, fell asleep. And when I woke it was from the light coming through the dusty windows. I'd slept the night through.<br><br>what had brought on our latest argument was what I claimed was Diana's flirtation with someone's houseguest at a backyard cocktail party the previous weekend.<br><br>I was not flirting, she said.<br><br>You were hitting on the guy.<br><br>Only in your peculiar imagination, Wakefield.<br><br>That's what she did when we argued-she used the last name. I wasn't Howard, I was Wakefield. It was one of her feminist adaptations of the locker-room style that I detested.<br><br>You made a suggestive remark, I said, and you clicked glasses with him.<br><br>It was not a suggestive remark, Diana said. It was a retort to something he'd said that was really stupid, if you want to know. Everyone laughed but you. I apologize for feeling good on occasion, Wakefield. I'll try not to feel that way ever again.<br><br>This is not the first time you've made a suggestive remark with your husband standing right there. And then denied all knowledge of it.<br><br>Leave me alone, please. God knows you've muzzled me to the point where I've lost all confidence in myself. I don't relate to people anymore. I'm too busy wondering if I'm saying the right thing.<br><br>You were relating to him, all right.<br><br>Do you think with the kind of relationship I've had with you I'd be inclined to start another with someone else? I just want to get through each day-that is all I think about, getting through each day.<br><br>That was probably true. On the train to the city, I had to admit to myself that I'd started the argument willfully, in a contrary spirit and with some sense of its eroticism. I did not really believe what I had accused her of. I was the one who came on to people. I had attributed to her my own wandering eye. That is the basis of jealousy, is it not? A feeling that your congenital insincerity is a universal? It did annoy me, seeing her talking to another man with a glass of white wine in her hand, and her innocent friendliness, which any man could mistake for a come-on, not just me. The fellow himself was not terribly prepossessing. But it bothered me that she was talking to him almost as if I were not standing there beside her.<br><br>Diana was naturally graceful and looked younger than she was. She still moved like the dancer she had been in college, her feet pointed slightly outward, her head high, her walk more a glide than something taken step by step. Even after carrying twins, she was as petite and slender as she had been when I met her.<br><br>And now in the first light of the new day I was totally bewildered by the situation I had created for myself. I can't claim that I was thinking rationally. But I actually felt that it would be a mistake to walk into my house and explain the sequence of events that had led me to spend the night in the garage attic. Diana would have been up till all hours, pacing the floor and worrying what had happened to me. My appearance, and her sense of relief, would enrage her. Either she would think that I had been with another woman or, if she did believe my story, it would strike her as so weird as to be a kind of benchmark in our married life. After all, we had had that argument the previous day. She would perceive what I told myself could not possibly be true-that something had happened predictive of a failed marriage. And the twins, budding adolescents, who generally thought of me as someone they were unfortunate to live in the same house with, an embarrassment in front of their friends, an oddity who knew nothing about their music-their alienation would be hissingly expressive. I thought of mother and daughters as the opposing team. The home team. I concluded that for now I would rather not go through the scene I had just imagined. Maybe later, I thought, just not now. I had yet to realize my talent for dereliction.<br><br>when i came down the garage stairs and relieved myself in the stand of bamboo, the cool air of the dawn welcomed me with a soft breeze. The raccoons were nowhere to be seen. My back was stiff and I felt the first pangs of hunger, but, in fact, I had to admit that I was not at that moment unhappy. What is there about a family that is so sacrosanct, I thought, that one should have to live in it for one's whole life, however unrealized one's life was?<br><br>From the shadow of the garage, I beheld the backyard, with its Norwegian maples, the tilted white birches, the ancient apple tree whose branches touched the windows of the family room, and for the first time, it seemed, I understood the green glory of this acreage as something indifferent to human life and quite apart from the Victorian manse set upon it. The sun was not yet up and the grass was draped with a wavy net of mist, punctured here and there with glistening drops of dew. White apple blossoms had begun to appear in the old tree, and I read the pale light in the sky as the shy illumination of a world to which I had yet to be introduced.<br><br>At this point, I suppose, I could have safely unlocked the back door and scuttled about in the kitchen, confident that everyone in the house was still asleep. Instead, I raised the lid of the garbage bin and found in one of the cans my complete dinner of the night before, slammed upside down atop a plastic bag and held in a circle of perfect integrity, as if still on the plate-a grilled veal chop, half a baked potato, peel-side up, and a small mound of oiled green salad- so that I could imagine the expression on Diana's face as she had come out here, still angry from our morning argument, and rid herself of the meal gone cold that she had stupidly cooked for that husband of hers.</p><h2>Rastafarian Art</h2><p>The Rastafarian religion in Jamaica came to prominence in the late 1960's and early 1970's and was given international exposure through the music of one of its main exponents Bob Marley. Music, and Reggae music in particular, was the centerpiece of Rasta creativity but Rastafarianism gave rise to a whole new cultural movement of which visual art was one of the many components. &#x2018;Official' recognition of Rasta art may be traced to the year 1980 when the National Gallery installed a new section dedicated to "intuitive" artists, that is, untrained artists who were previously described as primitive or na�ve. The works of Rastafarians were prominent among these intuitives including those of Albert Artwell, Ras Dizzy, Ras Daniel Hartman and Leonard Daley to name a few. <p>But beyond that, little, if any, recognition has been given to Rastafarian art as a particular genre within Jamaica, and the only known attempt to document and survey the art and handicraft of Rastafarians was in the form of an exhibition catalogue prepared for an exhibition in Germany in 1980 and updated 11 years later for a second exhibition for the Haus der Kulturen der Welt in Berlin Germany. </p><p>Now, almost 25 years after that first catalogue was produced, comes its first English translation. The works presented in this volume are meant to introduce a selection of Rastafarian artists from Jamaica. The collection is accompanied by photographs that depict everyday life among Jamaican Rastas and scenes from the environment in which the artists live. In addition there are interviews with a number of the artists, a chronology of events in the development of the Rastafarian movement and Rastafarian art, and an index of the artists and their works.</p></p><p></p><h2>Redwall</h2><p><b>"Mice are my heroes because, like children, mice are little and have to learn to be courageous and use their wits." --Brian Jacques</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Welcome to Redwall Abbey.

He takes us inside the Kremlin, the White House, secret military facilities, deep-cover safe houses, and the halls of Congress to bring to life the Russians and Americans who feared and distrusted their compatriots at least as much as their superpower rivals. &nbsp;Drawing on original interviews and new documentary sources, Brzezinski tells a story rich in the paranoia of the time. The combatants include three U.S. presidents, survivors of the gulag, corporate chieftains, ambitious apparatchiks, rehabilitated Nazis, and a general who won the day by refusing to follow orders. The true story of the birth of the space age has never been told in such dramatic detail, and Red Moon Rising brings it vividly and memorably to life.</p><p>For the fiftieth anniversary of Sputnik, the behind-the-scenes story of the fierce battles on Earth that launched the superpowers into space.<br> <br> The spy planes were driving Nikita Khrushchev mad.

The words whipped through my head as I stood in the cold hallway with my hand on the door leading to the stage. A sign on the door read: THIS IS NOT AN EXIT. The music thumped loudly -- all beats, whooshes, and wails, like a gospel diva trapped in a washing machine. I took a rushed breath, twisted the doorknob, and walked inside, going from the sunshine of the hallway to the midnight of the theater. </p><p> I couldn't see a thing, not really. It took what seemed like a full minute for my eyes to adjust to the darkness of the brick room painted black. I started to make out the outlines of figures seated in the rows of seats in front of the stage and standing along the back wall. The music continued to thump, louder now that I was inside, and the air smelled of Clorox and crotch. Beads of chilly sweat dripped from my armpits. My heartbeat quickened. Again those words, "Fuck it." </p><p> I started up the steps toward the stage and positioned myself in front of a large hanging screen that minutes earlier had been showing the fuzzy projected images of two California surfer dudes fucking by a pool. Once I made it to center stage, the D.J. in the overhead booth switched on the spotlight. I was now burning in a hard white sun. </p><p> Dressed in a too-tight T-shirt and shredded, hanging-off-my-ass jean shorts, I looked like the slutty boy at summer camp, the one who frequently disappears with the artsy male counselors. People were always telling me how young I looked, so I thought the camp thing worked for me. </p><p> Before my eyes could get used to the spotlight, the D.J. bellowed over the loudspeaker in a seventies game show announcer voice, "Gentlemen, welcome to the Follies. Our next dancer is making his first appearance here. Put your hands together for...[long dramatic pause] Craig." </p><p> "This is it," I thought. " There's no putting your khakis back on now." I stood there and started to dance a little bit, moving my feet from side to side with great deliberateness, like the gangly boys at the high school dance. Fortunately, there were no Chippendales-like dance routines needed here. It wasn't that kind of place. The guys who came to the Follies -- Washington, D.C.'s oldest gay porn theater and, if you believed their ads, home of the hottest "all male burlesque" -- wanted flesh and they wanted it fast. This was less striptease than strip-touch. The dancer's job was to get onstage, disrobe quickly, try to get a hard-on, and then walk out among the customers, who for a tip -- generally a buck -- got to stroke, fondle, poke, and prod the dancer's bod. It was more like sex than dancing, and it had become my job. </p><p> This was quite a change for me, since I spent most of my days as a graduate student and teacher at the University of Maryland in College Park: going to classes, giving lectures, grading papers, all on a campus so idyllic and grassy that it was used as the school in <i>St. Elmo's Fire</i>. But I was ready for a change. I <i>needed</i> it even if I couldn't explain exactly why. </p><p> I knew I was taking a risk by dancing here. The Follies itself could be a dangerous place. A 1977 fire took eight lives, among them a congressional aide, a Midwestern minister, an ex-marine, and an economist for the World Bank. Then, fifteen years later, more than a dozen flashlight-wielding cops stormed into the dark theater and arrested fourteen men on sodomy and other sex-related charges. Three dancers got caught up in the sweep. One guy, wearing only cowboy boots, was busted in the middle of his set. </p><p> I also was taking a risk because I wasn't sure what would happen if the people at school, especially my students or, even worse, their parents, found out about it. </p><p> But I didn't really care about these risks. I couldn't afford to. It was a journey I felt compelled to take -- the road less clothed -- and this was my first step. </p><p> As I stood there onstage, the wailing diva song played on. I knew I had to start taking something off, but I didn't really know <i>how</i> to do it. Like most people, I'd never given much thought to taking off my clothes. It was just something I did. But now I had an audience that was expecting me to do it, and it wasn't like there was a training course or apprenticeship program for aspiring strippers. </p><p> First I lifted up my T-shirt, gripping it from the bottom and pulling it inside out over my head. (I'd later find out that this was the girly way of taking off a shirt; a real man grabs it from the back of the collar and pulls it over his head.) Once my chest was bare, I sucked in my stomach and felt my nipples harden in the cold air. </p><p> Next I took off my jean shorts, first playing with the front snap, then slowly lowering the zipper and letting the denim drop. I wasn't wearing any underwear, because no self-respecting summer camp boy-slut wears drawers. Then I stepped out of the shorts, one leg at a time. I was now entirely naked, except for my sneakers and two white tube socks on my feet. My grandmother had given me these socks for Christmas a few months before, and I really liked them because they had dark gray patches at the toe and heel. </p><p> The next thing I had to worry about was my dick. It wasn't hard. It was even a little shrunken from the cold. I started tugging on it nervously. I didn't know what to do. When I jerked off at home, I was usually lying down watching a porn tape or flipping through a magazine, not standing upright in front of a room of strangers. I probably should've been thinking about something that turned me on, but my mind wasn't really working that way. I wasn't actually having thoughts. It was all a nervous rush. </p><p> I kept yanking on my dick. Hours, years, a full millennium seemed to pass. I tugged some more until I finally got it to a respectable hang. Once again I thought, "Fuck it," and headed out into the audience, walking down from the stage, carefully taking one step at a time. </p><p> I stood in front of the rows of seats and instantly felt safer. It was dark here, away from the spotlight of the stage. My heart rate slowed. </p><p> There was no one in the first two rows, which had several broken seats covered with duct tape, so I walked over to an older guy in the third row. He smiled as I stood in front of him and lifted my left leg, propping it on one of his armrests. He placed a folded dollar bill into my sock and put one hand firmly behind my balls, using the other hand to grab my dick. I got rock hard as he moved his hand back and forth. I couldn't explain why. It wasn't like he was hot or anything, and I could even make out a bit of old guy smell beneath the general Follies funk. But here I was, as hard as I'd ever been. It wasn't so much what the guy was doing to me as the fact that, after thinking about it for a long time, I was really doing this. </p><p> I stayed with him for about a minute. In my mind, I imagined a parking meter. I was wondering how much time he should get for a buck. My set lasted only ten minutes and there were about six other customers I had to get to. </p><p> I slowly pulled away from him, leaned over, and whispered, "Thank you." </p><p> "No," he responded. "Thank <i>you</i>." </p><p> I smiled and moved to my next customer, another older white dude, who asked, "What are you?" as he grabbed my package. </p><p> "Excuse me?" </p><p> "What are you? What nationality?" </p><p> "Um, American, the last time I checked my passport." </p><p> "I mean, what's your ethnic background? You look Hispanic or Filipino or something." </p><p> At the clubs, most of the dancers were white, with the occasional black, Latino, or I-dunno-looking guy like me thrown in. It made for some interesting conversations as customers tried to figure out if who you were matched who they wanted you to be. </p><p> "I'm black," I said. </p><p> "Really? You don't look it." I shrugged my shoulders. </p><p> "Is one of your parents white?" he asked. </p><p> "Nope." </p><p> "Oh, well, you have an interesting look." </p><p> "Thanks," I said, adding in my mind, "I guess." </p><p> I left this guy and moved on to the next customer, who sat in the back row. He was an Asian guy in his twenties. I positioned myself in front of him, my dick still at full mast. </p><p> "That looks dangerous," he said as he put some bills in my sock and started stroking me. "What is it, about ten inches?" </p><p> "I don't know," I said. "I've never measured it." I really hadn't. </p><p> His head lowered and his eyes fixed on my dick like it was some kind of target. Then he pulled on it with all his might like he was in a yanking contest at the county fair. </p><p> "Whoa, man. Slow down," I said. "Jeez." </p><p> I put my hand over his and moved it slowly back and forth. </p><p> "Like this," I said. He looked up sheepishly and gave me another tip. </p><p> With my time almost over, I made my way to the last guy in the back row, who was by far the weirdest. He was short and fat, with pale, pasty skin and a few shellacked wisps of hair plastered to his nearly bald scalp. When I stood in front of him, he tipped me and then reached for my dick with his thumb and forefinger like he was examining something in a laboratory. ("A human male penis. Interesting. Notice its firmness and veiny texture.") His clinical manner made my cock deflate instantly like a whoopee cushion underneath a fat ass. </p><p> "You can tell a lot about how a guy masturbates by the way he touches you," said Casey, one of the two other dancers I was working with, after I finished my set. We were sitting in the dressing room -- which was also a functioning broom closet -- waiting for the finale, where we all danced together. I used the time to debrief. </p><p> "Some of them are just plain weird, though," I said, "and then this one guy pulled it so hard that it was like he wanted to take it home as a souvenir. My dick felt like one of those metal handles that people hold on to while riding the subway." </p><p> Casey laughed and told me to buy a tube of Elbow Grease, a creamy, oil-based lubricant, from the front counter. "It helps cut down on the wear and tear," he explained, rubbing lotion over his arms, which had tattoos curling down them like colorful snakes. </p><p> We waited in the dr...</p></p><h2>Louis the Well-beloved (French Revolution Series)</h2><p>France eagerly awaits the day the young King, Louis XV, comes of age and breaks free from the rule of his ministers.

These include Cleopatra (1917) with Theda Bara, The Miracle Man (1919) with Lon Chaney, The Knickerbocker Buckaroo (1919) with Douglas Fairbanks, and The Divine Woman (1923) with Greta Garbo. Synopses are constructed from pressbooks, studio releases, and magazine articles. In one section, "The Production," Thompson provides background and reviews and suggests the film's place in cinema history. Plots for The Immortal Alamo (1911) and The Battle of Gettysburg (1913) reveal that in the past, as more recently, moviemakers took liberties with historical subjects. And a 1912 film set a record unmatched by today's TV docudramas: starring survivor and actress Dorothy Gibson, Saved from the Titanic was released a month and two days after the actual sinking. Highlighted by enlivening photographs, this is a unique book, well worth the price.<br><i>Kim Holston, American Inst. for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, Malvern, Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wildcats of Exeter: Volume VIII of the Domesday Books</h2><p>The discovery of a strangely mauled body prompts a murder investigation that could involve a bitter land dispute between two men, and the women who will most benefit from the outcome.</p><p>Edward Marston has written seven previous mysteries in this series. He is also the author of a popular series of mysteries set in the theater world of Elizabethan England, for which he received an Edgar Award nomination. A former history lecturer, he has written a number of original scripts for radio, television, and theater, as well as children&#39;s books, literary criticism and novels. He lives in England.The eighth of Marston's Domesday books (The Hawks of Delamere, etc.) fails to meet the high standards established by his Edgar-nominated Elizabethan series. In the aftermath of the Norman Conquest, England is still struggling with difficult Norman-Saxon relations. Nobleman Ralph Delchard and legal expert Gervase Bret, along with other members of the Royal Commissioners appointed by King William, are once again sent out to hear and settle land and tax disputes, this time to Exeter in Devon. Upon their arrival they learn that Nicolas Picard, whose property dispute they had been scheduled to hear, has been killed by a wildcat, but with a telling wound that could have been inflicted only by a human. Meanwhile, the list of claimants to the property in question has grown to five. Could one of them be a murderer? Limited description and dialogue fail to create an authentic atmosphere. When Delchard's wife, Golde, openly discusses her feelings about the snub she received from the sheriff's wife, Delchard tells Golde she was the "target for her anger," an analysis more of this century than the 11th. The presentation of the claims, the revelation of the facts, the deliberations and the commission's decision generate interest, but as a period mystery this is a disappointment.

With toddlers disappearing and rumors of a large, beast-like creature roaming the woods, Tackleford is in serious danger. And then there&#39;s Mildred&#39;s new dog Archibald... if you can even call it a dog. After all, what kind of dog drinks tea out of a cup? Everything comes to a head once the boys get a picture of the beast and Archibald goes missing. Is there a connection? And what does it all have to do with the magic pencil Mildred won from a carnie con game?</p><p>Born in a hidden village deep within the British Alps, John Allison came into this world a respectable baby with style and taste. Having been exposed to American comics at an early age, he spent decades honing his keen mind and his massive body in order to burn out this colonial cultural infection. One of the longest continuously publishing independent web-based cartoonists, John has plied his trade since the late nineties moving from Bobbins to Scary Go Round to Bad Machinery, developing the deeply weird world of Tackleford long after many of his fellow artists were ground into dust and bones by Time Itself. He has only once shed a single tear, but you only meet Sergio Aragon�s for the first time once. John resides in Letchworth Garden City, England, and is known to his fellow villagers only as He Who Has Conquered.Throughout the town of Tackleford, toddlers are being snatched up by a beastlike creature. Clearly this is a job for two groups of teen detectives: girls Mildred, Charlotte, and Shauna, who are also busy dealing with Mildred&#x2019;s magic pencil and a strange new pet that might not really be a dog; and boys Linton, Sonny, and Jack, who is crushing on Shauna and dealing with a violent school bully. Allison&#x2019;s series begins to hit its stride in this second volume, after The Case of the Team Spirit (2013). Though the characters don&#x2019;t get much of an introduction, even new fans will quickly pick up on who&#x2019;s who, thanks to distinctive body and face shapes and unique personalities. The story veers between realism and fantasy, with just a touch of absurdism to keep things fun. Teens will likely admire Sonny&#x2019;s stubborn uniqueness, laugh at Shauna&#x2019;s reluctant love of her baby brother, and appreciate Mildred&#x2019;s ability to skirt her parents&#x2019; sillier rules. The bright, colorful art and snarky dialogue are icing on a delightful cake.

Now, on the occasion of their fiftieth anniversary, Random House is proud to bring the three timeless tales together in one beautiful commemorative edition, complete with the original delightful illustrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Newbery Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, <i>My Father's Dragon</i> is followed by <i>Elmer and the Dragon</i> ("rich, humorous, and thoroughly satisfying"*) and <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> ("ingenious and plausible, the fantasy well-sustained"*).&nbsp;&nbsp;Each story stands alone, but read in succession, they are an unforgettable experience.*<i>Library Journal</i>, starred review&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>My Father's Dragon</i>--a favorite of young readers since the 1940s and a Newbery honor book--captures the nonsensical logic of childhood in an amusingly deadpan fashion. The story begins when Elmer Elevator (the narrator's father as a boy) runs away with an old alley cat to rescue a flying baby dragon being exploited on a faraway island. With the help of two dozen pink lollipops, rubber bands, chewing gum, and a fine-toothed comb, Elmer disarms the fiercest of beasts on Wild Island. The quirky, comical adventure ends with a heroic denouement: the freeing of the dragon. Abundant black-and-white lithographs by Ruth Chrisman Gannett (the author's stepmother) add an evocative, lighthearted mood to an already enchanting story. Author Ruth Stiles Gannett's stand-alone sequel, <i>Elmer and the Dragon</i>, and her third volume, <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> both received starred reviews in <i>School Library Journal</i> and are as fresh and original as her first. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>"Delightfully logical nonsense, appealing characters and irrepressible humor." -<i>The New York Times</i><br></p><h2>Christmas Angels</h2><p>Oversized die-cut format with a great value price.

She walked through 105-degree deserts and blinding blizzards, despite arthritis and emphysema. Along her way, her remarkable speeches &#x2014; rich with wisdom, love, and political insight &#x2014; transformed individuals and communities and jump-started a full-blown movement. She became a national heroine. <br><br>On her journey, Haddock kept a diary &#x2014; tracking the progress of her walk and recalling events in her life and the insights that have given her. <b>Granny D</b> celebrates an exuberant life of love, activism, and adventure &#x2014; from writing one-woman feminist plays in the 1930s to stopping nuclear testing near an Eskimo fishing village in 1960 to Haddock&#x2019;s current crusade.

Along her route, she was greeted with marching bands, serenades, and parades. She spoke to children, bikers, fraternity boys, politicians, and wayward wanderers alike (some of whom joined her). She also caught the attention of journalists, though some were more interested in the little-old-lady angle than the reform message, but Granny became an expert at keeping the focus on her lobbying effort. And though various TV networks canceled their coverage because she was a "soft news" story, she managed to direct plenty of attention to her cause. Bronchitis, emphysema, and arthritis plagued her--not to mention the other aches and pains that would afflict the toughest of bodies on a 3,000-mile hike. Averaging 10 miles per day, she fought challenging terrain, heat, and even a twister in Texas that almost carried her right off the road. And she celebrated her 90th birthday along the way. <p> The book is not all politics, though. As various people, events, and places spark memories of her life, she steps back from the topic of finance reform and shares many personal moments: falling in love, the formation of deep friendships, working through grief. The tone is witty and conversational and fraught with bits of wisdom. Much more than a political platform or a call to action, <i>Granny D</i> also chronicles a rich and meaningful life. <i>--Jacque Holthusen</i></p>In February 2000, ninety-year-old Doris ?Granny D?

He knew, of course, that it was only in his mind&#x2019;s eye, but at times, like right now, the vision was so real he had to lower his camera and take a good hard look at the ground in front of him. That horrible moment&#x2014;the moment Ray&#x2019;s life changed completely, transforming him from a man with a future and aspirations into this Grade-A loser you see in front of you&#x2014;never visited him in his dreams or when he sat alone in the dark. The devastating visions waited until he was wide-awake, surrounded by people, busy at what some might sarcastically dub work.</p><p>The visions mercifully faded as Ray continuously snapped pictures of the bar mitzvah boy.</p><p>&#x201c;Look this way, Ira,&#x201d; Ray shouted from behind his lens. &#x201c;Who are you wearing? Is it true Jen and Angelina are still fighting over you?&#x201d;</p><p>Someone kicked Ray&#x2019;s shin. Someone else pushed him. Ray kept snapping pictures of Ira.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is the after-party, Ira? What lucky girl is getting the first dance?&#x201d;</p><p>Ira Edelstein frowned and shielded his face from the camera lens. Ray surged forward undaunted, snapping pictures from every angle. &#x201c;Get out of the way!&#x201d; someone shouted. Someone else pushed him. Ray tried to steady himself.</p><p><i>Snap, snap, snap.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Damn paparazzi!&#x201d; Ira shouted. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t I have a moment of peace?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray rolled his eyes. He did not back off. From behind his camera lens, the vision with the blood returned. He tried to shake it off, but it would not go. Ray kept his finger pressed down on the shutter. Ira the Bar Mitzvah Boy moved in a slow-motion strobe now.</p><p>&#x201c;Parasites!&#x201d; Ira screamed.</p><p>Ray wondered if it was possible to sink any lower.</p><p>Another kick to the shins gave Ray his answer: Nope.</p><p>Ira&#x2019;s &#x201c;bodyguard&#x201d;&#x2014;an enormous guy with a shaved head named Fester&#x2014;swept Ray aside with a forearm the size of an oak. The sweep was with a bit too much gusto, nearly knocking him off his feet. Ray gave Fester a &#x201c;what gives&#x201d; look. Fester mouthed an apology.</p><p>Fester was Ray&#x2019;s boss and friend and the owner of Celeb Experience: Paparazzi for Hire&#x2014;which was just what it sounded like. Ray didn&#x2019;t stalk celebrities hoping to get compromising shots to sell to tabloids like a real paparazzo. No, Ray was actually beneath that&#x2014;Beatlemania to the Beatles&#x2014;offering the &#x201c;celebrity experience&#x201d; to wannabes who were willing to pay. In short, clients, most with extreme self-esteem and probably erectile dysfunction issues, hired paparazzi to follow them around, snapping pictures to give them, per the brochure, the &#x201c;ultimate celebrity experience with your very own exclusive paparazzi.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray could sink lower, he supposed, but not without an extreme act of God.</p><p>The Edelsteins had purchased the A-List MegaPackage&#x2014;two hours with three paparazzi, one bodyguard, one publicist, one boom-mike handler, all following around the &#x201c;celebrity&#x201d; and snapping pictures of him as though he were Charlie Sheen sneaking into a monastery. The A-List MegaPackage also came with a souvenir DVD for no extra charge, plus your face on one of those cheesy-fake gossip magazine covers with a custom-made headline.</p><p>The cost for the A-List MegaPackage?</p><p>Four grand.</p><p>To answer the obvious question: Yes, Ray hated himself.</p><p>Ira pushed past and disappeared into the ballroom. Ray lowered his camera and looked at his two fellow paparazzi. Neither one of them had the loser <i>L</i> tattooed on their forehead because, really, it would have been redundant.</p><p>Ray checked his watch. &#x201c;Damn,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We still have fifteen minutes on the clock.&#x201d;</p><p>His colleagues&#x2014;both barely bright enough to write their names in the dirt with a finger&#x2014;groaned. Fifteen more minutes. That meant going inside and working the introduction. Ray hated that.</p><p>The bar mitzvah was being held at the Wingfield Manor, a ridiculously gauche banquet hall that, if scaled back a tad, could have doubled as one of Saddam Hussein&#x2019;s palaces. There were chandeliers and mirrors and faux ivory and ornate woodwork and lots and lots of shimmering gold paint.</p><p>The image of the blood came back to him. He blinked it away.</p><p>The event was black-tie. The men looked worn and rich. The women looked well kept and surgically enhanced. Ray pushed through the crowds, wearing jeans, a wrinkled gray blazer, and black Chuck Taylor Hi-Tops. Several guests stared at him as though he&#x2019;d just defecated on their salad fork.</p><p>There was an eighteen-piece band plus a &#x201c;facilitator&#x201d; who was supposed to encourage guest frolicking of all sorts. Think bad TV-game-show host. Think Muppets&#x2019; Guy Smiley. The facilitator grabbed the microphone and said, &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen,&#x201d; in a voice reminiscent of a boxing ring announcer, &#x201c;please welcome, for the first time since receiving the Torah and becoming a man, give it up for the one, the only... Ira Edelstein!&#x201d;</p><p>Ira appeared with two... Ray wasn&#x2019;t sure what the right terminology was but perhaps the best phrase would be &#x201c;upscale strippers.&#x201d; The two hot chicks escorted little Ira into the room by the cleavage. Ray got the camera ready and pushed forward, shaking his head. The kid was thirteen. If women who looked like that were ever that close to him when he was thirteen, he&#x2019;d have an erection for a week.</p><p>Ah youth.</p><p>The applause was rapturous. Ira gave the crowd a royal wave.</p><p>&#x201c;Ira!&#x201d; Ray called out. &#x201c;Are these your new goddesses? Is it true you may be adding a third to your harem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please,&#x201d; Ira said with a practiced whine, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m entitled to my privacy!&#x201d;</p><p>Ray managed not to vomit. &#x201c;But your public wants to know.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester the Sunglassed Bodyguard put a large mitt on Ray, allowing Ira to brush past him. Ray snapped, making sure the flash worked its magic. The band exploded&#x2014;when did weddings and bar mitzvahs start playing music at a rock-stadium decibel?&#x2014;into the new celebration anthem &#x201c;Club Can&#x2019;t Handle Me.&#x201d; Ira dirty-danced with the two hired helpers. Then his thirteen-year-old friends joined in, crowding the dance floor, jumping straight up and down like pogo sticks. Ray &#x201c;fought&#x201d; through Fester, snapped some more pictures, checked his watch.</p><p>One more minute on the clock.</p><p>&#x201c;Paparazzi scum!&#x201d;</p><p>Another kick to the shins from some little cretin.</p><p>&#x201c;Ow, damn it, that hurt!&#x201d;</p><p>The cretin scurried away. Note to self, Ray thought: Start wearing shin guards. He looked over at Fester as though begging for mercy. Fester let him off the hook with a head gesture to follow him toward the corner. The corner was too loud so they slipped through the doors.</p><p>Fester pointed back into the ballroom with his enormous thumb. &#x201c;Kid did a great job on his haftorah portion, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;</p><p>Ray just stared at him.</p><p>&#x201c;I got a job for you tomorrow,&#x201d; Fester said.</p><p>&#x201c;Groovy. What is it?&#x201d;</p><p>Fester looked off.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t like that. &#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s George Queller.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dear God.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. And he wants the usual.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray sighed. George Queller tried to impress first dates by overwhelming and ultimately terrifying them. He would hire Celeb Experience to swarm him and his date&#x2014;for example, last month it was a woman named Nancy&#x2014;as they entered a small romantic bistro. Once the date was safely inside, she would be presented with&#x2014;no, this was for real&#x2014;a custom-made menu that would read, &#x201c;George and Nancy&#x2019;s First Date of Many, Many&#x201d; with the address, month, day, and year printed beneath. When they left the restaurant, the paparazzi for hire would be there, snapping away and shouting at how George had turned down a weekend in Turks and Caicos with Jessica Alba for the lovely and now-terror-stricken Nancy.</p><p>George considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to happy-ever-after. Nancy and her ilk considered these romantic maneuvers a prelude to a ball gag and secluded storage unit.</p><p>There had never been a second date for George.</p><p>Fester finally took off his sunglasses. &#x201c;I want you to work lead on the job.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lead paparazzo,&#x201d; Ray said. &#x201c;I better call my mother, so she can brag to her mahjong group.&#x201d;</p><p>Fester chuckled. &#x201c;I love you, you know that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are we done here?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We are.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray packed away his camera carefully, separating the lens from the body, and threw the case over his shoulder. He limped toward the door, not from the kicks but the hunk of shrapnel in his hip&#x2014;the shrapnel that started his downward slide. No, that was too simple. The shrapnel was an excuse. At one time in his miserable life, Ray had fairly limitless potential. He&#x2019;d graduated from Columbia University&#x2019;s School of Journalism with what one professor called &#x201c;almost supernatural talent&#x201d;&#x2014;now being wasted&#x2014;in the area of photojournalism. But in the end, that life didn&#x2019;t work out for him. Some people are drawn to trouble. Some people, no matter how easy the path they are given on the walk of life, will find a way to mess it all up.</p><p>Ray Levine was one of those people.</p><p>It was dark out. Ray debated whether he should just head home and go to bed or hit a bar so seedy it was called Tetanus. Tough call when you have so many options.</p><p>He thought about the dead body again.</p><p>The visions came fast and furious now. That was understandable, he supposed. Today was the anniversary of the day it all ended, when any hope of happy-ever-after died like... Well, the obvious metaphor here would involve the visions in his head, wouldn&#x2019;t it?</p><p>He frowned. Hey, Ray, melodramatic much?</p><p>He had hoped that today&#x2019;s inane job would take his mind off it. It hadn&#x2019;t. He remembered his own bar mitzvah, the moment on the pulpit when his father bent down and whispered in his ear. He remembered how his father had smelled of Old Spice, how his father&#x2019;s hand cupped Ray&#x2019;s head so gently, how his father with tears in his eyes simply said, &#x201c;I love you so much.&#x201d;</p><p>Ray pushed the thought away. Less painful to think about the dead body.</p><p>The valets had wanted to charge him&#x2014;no professional courtesy, he guessed&#x2014;so Ray had found a spot three blocks down on a side street. He made the turn, and there it was&#x2014;his piece-o-crap, twelve-year-old Honda Civic with a missing bumper and duct tape holding together a side window. Ray rubbed his chin. Unshaven. Unshaven, forty years old, piece-o-crap car, a basement apartment that if heavily renovated might qualify as a crap hole, no prospects, drank too much. He would feel sorry for himself, but that would involve, well, caring.</p><p>Ray was just taking out his car key when the heavy blow landed on the back of his head.</p><p>What the...?</p><p>He dropped to one knee. The world went dark. The tingle ran up his scalp. Ray felt disoriented. He tried to shake his head, tried to clear it.</p><p>Another blow landed near his temple.</p><p>Something inside his head exploded in a flash of bright light. Ray collapsed to the ground, his body splayed out. He may have lost consciousness&#x2014;he wasn&#x2019;t sure&#x2014;but suddenly he felt a pulling in his right shoulder. For a moment he just lay limp, not able or wanting to resist. His head reeled in agony. The primitive part of his brain, the base animal section, had gone into survivor mode. Escape more punishment, it said. Crawl into a ball and cover up.</p><p>Another hard tug nearly tore his shoulder out. The tug lessened and began to slip away, and with it, a realization made Ray&#x2019;s eyes snap open.</p><p>Someone was stealing his camera.</p><p>The camera was a classic Leica with a recently updated digital-send feature. He felt his arm lift in the air, the strap running up it. In a second, no more, the camera would be gone.</p><p>Ray didn&#x2019;t have much. The camera was the only possession he truly cherished. It was his livelihood, sure, but it was also the only link to old Ray, to that life he had known before the blood, and he&#x2019;d be damned if he&#x2019;d give that up without a fight.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>The strap was off his arm now. He wondered whether he&#x2019;d have another opportunity, whether the mugger would go for the fourteen bucks in his wallet and give Ray a chance. Couldn&#x2019;t wait to find out.</p><p>With his head still swimming and his knees wobbling, Ray shouted, &#x201c;No!&#x201d; and tried to launch...</p></p><h2>Lives, XI: Aratus. Artaxerxes. Galba. Otho. General Index (Loeb Classical Library) (Volume XI)</h2><p><p>Plutarch (Plutarchus), ca. 45&#x2013;120 CE, was born at Chaeronea in Boeotia in central Greece, studied philosophy at Athens, and, after coming to Rome as a teacher in philosophy, was given consular rank by the emperor Trajan and a procuratorship in Greece by Hadrian. He was married and the father of one daughter and four sons. He appears as a man of kindly character and independent thought, studious and learned.</p><p>Plutarch wrote on many subjects. Most popular have always been the 46 <i>Parallel Lives</i>, biographies planned to be ethical examples in pairs (in each pair, one Greek figure and one similar Roman), though the last four lives are single. All are invaluable sources of our knowledge of the lives and characters of Greek and Roman statesmen, soldiers and orators. Plutarch's many other varied extant works, about 60 in number, are known as <i>Moralia</i> or Moral Essays. They are of high literary value, besides being of great use to people interested in philosophy, ethics and religion.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of the <i>Lives</i> is in eleven volumes.</p></p><p><p>Bernadotte Perrin (1847&#x2013;1920) was Lampson Professor of Greek Literature and History at Yale University.</p></p><h2>Depression Glass by Duncan (Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>The Duncan &amp; Miller Glass Company, of Washington, Pennsylvania, was one of the glassmaking giants of the 1920s -1940s.

With a Foreword by Sir Paul McCartney.</p><p>According to horse trainer Tanya Larrigan, the voice is by far the most neglected of the rider&#39;s aids. Using voice aids as a common thread, Larrigan encourages riders and handlers to widen their horizons and explore the many different ways in which horses can be trained and enioyed. The essence of Larrigan&#39;s philosophy is that work with horses should be fun--both for the horse and the handler. She shows that cooperation--not domination--is the way forward, and the key to her technique is the use of the human voice. The most natural of aids, the voice can take a trainer into a new dimension of understanding. Larrigan carefully demonstrates how to teach a horse a vocabulary that extends beyond the normal range of verbal commands, and how more sophisticated voice aids can help in training on the ground, in long reins, and under saddle. Tanya Larrigan is a talented all-round horsewoman who has shown competitively in Western riding, show jumping, dressage, and eventing. She has twice been a member of the British Olympic squad.</p><h2>Living Artfully: At Home with Marjorie Merriweather Post</h2><p>Living Artfully: At Home with Marjorie Merriweather Post [paperback edition]</p><p></p><h2>Our Family Time with God (family devotions for every day of the year)</h2><p>family devotions</p><p></p><h2>Secret and Dangerous: Night of the Son Tay POW Raid</h2><p>A thrilling eyewitness account of the secret humanitarian mission in 1970 by one of the pilots who flew the amazing C-130 aircraft on the edge of a stall at night while leading six helicopters in close formation deep into North Vietnam for a daring rescue attempt of POWs being held in the shadows of Hanoi. <p>As a two-part story, it also describes the same raider-pilot's return to Son Tay prison 24 years later, in broad daylight with camera in hand, including his high-anxiety confrontation and arrest by North Vietnamese police. </p><p>It includes 64 rare pictures and diagrams, most never declassified and published until now.</p></p><p>William A.

The poems proliferate into a rich landscape of correspondences and metaphorical discovery: "You could see / whole worlds in nutshells," she writes, and Glynn weaves in and out of an intense focus on the herbarium itself and the connections with everyday contemporary life she finds there. Whether it is in a poem about the olive or the nettle, the narcissus or the milkweed, Glynn's vision of her subjects, and her voice, are both ancient and contemporary, combining a lush lyricism with modern rhythms of speech. In her hands, these specimens manifest our most human emotions as she conjures a world of perception from each.

In 21 haunting prose poems, he meditates on his father's death and black American familial realities (the unmarried mother, the girl in school with the same last name) and comes to terms with specific childhood memories. The poems are related through image, not chronology, and the tone ranges from confessional to ironic. Emotions are similarly tumultuous and conflicting. But mobility and tension, stress and stupor give this volume its prowess. It is disconcerting to see six pages of blurbs fleshing out 33 pages of poetry, but that cannot undermine this honest and heartfelt dirge, especially when the "silly boy" who (in his father's eyes) never did real work explains near the end, "They're paying me to write about your life."?Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, "Soho Weekly News," New York<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Catherine de Medici: A Biography</h2><p>Shipped from UK, please allow 10 to 21 business days for arrival. Fine, A fine copy in burgundy cloth boards, gilt title on spine, colour illustrated endpapers, with a fine dust jacket.</p><p><p>Swedish by birth, Leonie Frieda speaks five languages. This is her first book. She lives in London with her daughter and son.</p>In 1533, 14-year-old Catherine de Medici arrived in France to marry the future king Henri II; over the next 16 years, she endured the dominance of Henri's mistress, Diane de Poitiers, and the disdain of courtiers for her family's merchant background. The sudden death of Henri launched Catherine into three decades as regent and chief adviser to three sons who ruled in succession. Frieda navigates the twists and turns of the French royal court and family with particular attention to the formation of Catherine's political skills. From her lonely childhood as a tool in the diplomacy of her powerful uncles to her carefully cultivated relationship with her father-in-law and maneuvering through shifting family alliances, the queen learned self-possession, deception and strategy. While Catherine has been maligned for her role in France's wars of religion and in particular the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre, Frieda argues that Catherine attempted to reach compromise in the religious strife of her adopted country. While trying to flesh out Catherine, Frieda occasionally paints others with a too-broad brush. At times, her descriptions of Catherine's actions as emotionally or politically motivated seem arbitrary. But Frieda's portrait of Catherine is multifaceted, and her presentation of the complicated narrative of five tumultuous reigns is compelling. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

NEW DIRECTIONS Although anthologies of prayer abound, this one stands out fin- being both a history of Christian faith as ;veil as a huge treasury of prayers. THE SIGN 1000 Years of Prayer oilers a vast tapestry of prayer, complex and richly woven, which depicts how men and women of all ages and all cultures have expressed (heir longing for God clown the centuries. Many ancient prayers - those which have shaped our basic understanding of who God is and what it means to be human - are included. Many more, by writers from Alcuin to R S Thomas, have made a lasting and profound contribution to world literature. Others are simple, childlike and heartfelt; these have arisen out of the joys and struggles of human life over the last two thousand years, and strike both personal and universal chords. Contemporary prayers attempt to embrace the challenges of today&#39;s world, while prayers from African, Asian, Native American and Celtic peoples remind us of the divine presence which permeates the whole of life. Here can be found the prayers of saints and slaves, poets and kings, mothers and lovers, soldiers and artists, those starting out on new ventures and those at the end of their lives. From the erudite to the humorous, from the poetic to the homespun, from the theological to the childlike, the prayers in this beautiful anthology will give us words with which to explore the fathomless mysteries of God.</p><p>"This resource is a must for every library." -- <i>The Counselor, Feb. 27, 2000</i><br><br>"This vast collection of prayers...is a marvelous resource...with prayers both famous and obscure from most every major religious figure in the history of the church. 2000 Years of Prayer should be on the shelf of anyone serious about spiritual devotion." -- <i>Religion and Liberty, Jan-Feb 2000</i><br><br>... a tremendous resource... helpful in the spiritual lives of many believers...

Original.</p><p>Get an old-timer going, and stories of the past will come tumbling out for hours on end. These are really the stories of <i>our</i> past in that they tie us to our tradition. In <i>Kahunas of Light: The World of Hawaiian Spirituality</i> Moke Kupihea tells stories like an old-timer but with more polish. The stories of his past are the stories of his spirituality--of his ancestors on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, of his deep relationship with the land, and of the kahunas of his youth who shared their wisdom. Stories are the way Kupihea reconstructs the crumbling edifice of Hawaiian religiousness, linking generations through the ancient notion of the <i>aumakua</i>, or ancestral spirit. Although plodding at times, and often lacking a vigorous narrative movement, Kupihea reveals the meaningful days of his youth spent exploring cliff-side caves, rowing canoes in secluded streams, and coming face to face with the luminous spirit guides. He says that we can reclaim our past and our spirit--and shares how he has done just that. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Moke Kupihea has lived his whole life in Kauai&#39;s Waimea Valley.

Though professionals have been theorizing about it for years, the phenomenon called autism has re mained shrouded in mystery. The au thor makes a few dents in this mys tique, giving us insights which are rare because autism by its nature generally precludes such expression and analysis of emotion.

And who better to flesh out these powerful and malevolent aliens, so dismissive and disdainful of humanity, than R.A.

With a script based on a Samurai epic, an American TV actor called Clint Eastwood, music composer Ennio Morricone and cameraman Massimo Dallamano, Leone was expected to make what was essentially a throwaway film. What he ended up with was A Fistful of Dollars, the first in a trilogy that came to define the Spaghetti Western. The films that complete the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, are, like the first film, violent, cynical and visually stunning. This examination of Leone and the Italian Western contains an authoritative text written by film expert and cultural historian Christopher Frayling. It also includes interviews with Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Sergio Leone, Rod Steiger, Ennio Morricone, James Coburn, Lee Van Cleef, Peter Bogdanovich, Bernardo Bertolucci, Jason Robards and Claudia Cardinale, as well as writings by Sergio Leone on film. The text is accompanied by a wealth of visual material, including production stills, lobby cards, pictorial source sketches, costume and set designs, Italian release posters and photographs of original props.</p><p>Historian, critic and broadcaster Sir Christopher Frayling has been Rector at London&#39;s Royal College of Art since 1996, and a Professor of Cultural History for more than twenty years.Sergio Leone is identified with spaghetti WesternsDviolent, visually imaginative Sixties and Seventies films that exploded the clich s of the Hollywood Western. Leone brought stardom to TV actor Clint Eastwood, who was cast as an antihero alien to Westerns and who admitted that Leone "really doesn't know anything about the West." Instead, the director's West existed as a sort of fever dream, and his tales, the author notes, were "fairy-tales for grown-ups." In the first detailed study of this original director, Frayling (Spaghetti Westerns) explores Leone's years of apprenticeship on American films shot in Italy, such as Ben Hur and sword-and-sandal epics like Colossus of Rhodes, which refined Leone's distinctive visual storytelling style. His imagination, however, was fired by the classic Westerns of John Ford. Frayling discusses the director's offbeat humor and considers the charges of misogyny and excessive violence without defending him. These features were evident in Leone's last film, Once Upon a Time in America (1984), an all-star gangster saga that confounded critics and admirers. This informative look at an underappreciated director should spark reappraisals of his work.

Tour.</p><p>A biography that explains coherently--despite its rather thick layer of pop psych--why Benedict Arnold became the American Revolution's Lucifer, the brightest angel who suffered the steepest fall from grace. Colonial historian Brandt (An American Aristocracy, 1986) locates the seed of Arnold's treason in ``the great American virus: social insecurity.'' In his teens, Arnold was forced to leave an elite private academy because of his alcoholic father's bankruptcy. Brandt's prose can rise to an almost hysterically portentous pitch (Arnold ``teetered on the brink of an inner abyss that had been gouged in his soul by the earthquake that had struck''), but despite a lack of subtlety in characterization, her thesis enables her to identify ambition as the connecting thread between Arnold as energetic, intelligent, and courageous soldier and Arnold as greedy traitor. Notoriously touchy about the most dimly perceived slights, Arnold could take no solace in his reputation as the best American battlefield general of the war. Lacking a moral compass, he saw money and social prestige as his surest validations of character- -and, when these were lacking, he alienated potential allies with petulant outbursts. His downfall began when, as military commandant of Philadelphia, he mixed with well-heeled Loyalists (including his future wife, the beautiful Peggy Shippen) and engaged in war profiteering. Brandt takes us through the familiar events that followed: Arnold's court-martial for financial malfeasance, his bungled attempt to hand over West Point to the British, and his final years as a financially insecure social leper in Canada and England. Despite Arnold's ``mighty heart,'' he was brought down by self-delusion and a reckless unconcern for any but himself (he sealed Major John Andre's doom by needlessly sending him behind Continental lines disguised as a civilian). Piercing insights into one of our most infamous figures, though no match for Willard Sterne Randall's superb Benedict Arnold (1990). (Maps and b&amp;w illustrations--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Brandt ( An American Aristocracy: The Livingstons ) convincingly portrays notorious colonial turncoat Arnold's (1741-1801) actions as the result of numerous insecurities, slights and ambitions. Though her psychologizing is at times overwrought, Brandt's lively account is multidimensional, based on a wealth of sources. She traces how young Arnold's hopes for a college education were dashed by his alcoholic father, and how as a New Haven, Conn., entrepreneur he craved wealth as a sign of his worth. Arnold continually battled his inner demons--as a militia officer arguing with rivals, as an ambitious soldier bereft of his dead wife, as a hero who saved his country from the British fleet but made numerous enemies among his compatriots and in congress. Stung by court-martial charges, Arnold turned to the British, but his plot to deliver the West Point garrison failed. Stripped of his image as "Patriot-Hero," Arnold concocted rationalizations for his treachery and arguments for British military strategy. But his plans to restore his reputation went awry, and, intending only to visit England in 1792, he stayed there until his death. Illustrations not seen by PW.

The roster of celebrated names includes Carin Berger, whose <i>The Little Yellow Leaf</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> Best Illustrated Children's Book; Eric Puybaret, who brought the bestselling <i>Puff, the Magic Dragon</i> to life on the page; Coretta Scott King Honor Award winner Sean Qualls; and Caldecott Honor medalist Melissa Sweet. An accompanying CD, with lilting songs beautifully composed and sung by Emily Gary and Tom Proutt, makes this the perfect gift to wish children a sweet goodnight. &nbsp;The illustrators are: Jonathan Bean * Carin Berger * Sophie Blackall * Linda Bleck * Renata Liwska * Christopher Silas Neal&nbsp; * Zachariah OHora * Eric Puybaret * Sean Qualls *&nbsp; Isabel Roxas * Melissa Sweet * Dan Yaccarino&nbsp;</p><p><p>Margaret Wise Brown is one of the most popular children's authors of all time; her classic <i>Goodnight Moon</i> (HarperFestival), illustrated by Clement Hurd, has sold more than twenty-four million copies and her books&#x2014;including <i>Big Red Barn</i> (Harper Festival), <i>The</i> <i>Runaway Bunny</i> (HarperCollins), and <i>The Golden Egg Book</i> (Simon &amp; Schuster)&#x2014;have never been out of print. Several generations have grown up with her timeless stories and her influence has been felt around the world.</p>PreS&#x2014;This unique book was a long time in the making: more than 20 years ago, various unpublished works of the late, great author were discovered in her sister's barn, including many song lyrics. Presented here for the first time are 12 of Brown's lullabies, each one illustrated by a different award-winning picture-book artist. Each spread showcases the unique style of the illustrator and brings to life Brown's dulcet text. In "the noon balloon," Renata Liwska's dreamy pencil work is used to full effect as softly textured animals drift away for a midday snooze. Sean Qualls's fanciful and luminous nighttime sky perfectly accompanies the text: "When the man in the moon was a little boy.... He ran away with a shooting star." Carin Berger's collage scene for "When I Close My Eyes at Night" features 3D-like silhouettes of a sleeping village and billowing clouds that look like striped pajama pants. Nine other artists lend their talents, including Jonathan Bean, Sophie Blackall, Linda Bleck, Christopher Silas Neal, Zachariah Ohora, Eric Puybaret, Isabel Roxas, Melissa Sweet, and Dan Yaccarino. There is a timeless feel to many of Brown's lyrics ("Sleep like a rabbit, sleep like a bear./Sleep like the old cat under the chair"; "Baby, sail the seven seas/Safely in my arms. When the waves go up and down/You are safe from harm"), and children will respond to the gentle rhythms and soothing language. Accompanying the book is a CD with songs composed and sung by singer/songwriters Tom Proutt and Emily Gary. These tranquil poems are best shared one-on-one, preferably in the lap of a caring adult right before tuck-in time.

The country has been invaded and is being governed by a secret organization. There is destruction everywhere; great walls of ice overrun the world. Together with the narrator, the reader is swept into a hallucinatory quest for this strange and fragile creature with albino hair. Acclaimed upon its 1967&nbsp;publication&nbsp;as the best science fiction book of the year, this extraordinary and innovative novel has subsequently been recognized as a major work of literature in its own right.</p><p><b>Anna Kavan</b> was one of the greatest unsung enigmas in 20th-century British literature. Born Helen Ferguson, a fraught childhood and two failed marriages led her to change her name to that of one of her characters. Despite struggling with mental illness and heroin addiction for most of her life, she was still able to write fiction that was as powerful and memorable as any English female writer of the last 150 years.It was essential for me to find her without delay. The situation was alarming, the atmosphere tense, the emergency imminent. There was talk of a secret act of aggression by some foreign power, but no one knew what had actually happened. The government would not disclose the facts. I was informed privately of a steep rise in radioactive pollution, pointing to the explosion of a nuclear device, but of an unknown type, the consequences of which could not be accurately predicted. It was possible that polar modifications had resulted, and would lead to a substantial climatic change due to the refraction of solar heat. If the melting Antarctic ice cap flowed over the South Pacific and Atlantic oceans, a vast ice-mass would be created, reflecting the sun&#x2019;s rays and throwing them back into outer space, thus depriving the earth of warmth. In town, everything was chaotic and contradictory. News from abroad was censored, but travel was left unrestricted.<br><br> Confusion was increased by a spate of new and conflicting regulations, and by the arbitrary way controls were imposed or lifted. The one thing that would have clarified the position was an overall picture of world events; but this was prohibited by the determination of the politicians to ban all foreign news. My impression was that they had lost their heads, did not know how to deal with the approaching danger, and hoped to keep the public in ignorance of its exact nature until a plan had been evolved.<br><br> No doubt people would have been more concerned, and would have made greater efforts to find out what was taking place in other countries, if, at home, they had not been obliged to contend with the fuel shortage, the power cuts, the breakdown of transport, and the rapid diversion of supplies to the black market.<br><br> There was no sign of a break in the abnormal cold. My room was reasonably warm, but even in hotels heating was being reduced to a minimum, and, outside, the erratic, restricted services hampered my investigations. The river had been frozen over for weeks, the total paralysis of the docks was a serious problem. All essential commodities were in short supply; rationing, at least of fuel and food, could not be delayed much longer, despite the reluctance of those in power to resort to unpopular measures.<br><br> Everyone who could do so was leaving in search of better conditions. No more passages were available, either by sea or air; there were long waiting lists for all ships and planes. I had no proof that the girl was already abroad. On the whole it seemed unlikely she would have managed to leave the country, and an obscure train of thought suggested that she might embark on a certain vessel.<br> The port was a long way off, to reach it involved a long complicated journey. I was delayed, got there, after traveling all night, only an hour before sailing time. The passengers were already aboard, crowding the decks with friends who were seeing them off. The first thing I had to do was to speak to the captain. He turned out to be maddeningly talkative. While I became more and more impatient, he complained at great length about the way the authorities allowed overcrowding: it was a danger to his ship, unfair to himself, to the company, the passengers, the insurance people. That was his business. As soon as I got permission to get on with my own, I made a methodical search of the ship, but without finding a trace of the person I wanted.<br> Finally I gave up in despair and went out on deck. Too tired and disheartened to push through the crowds of people milling about there, I stood by the rail, overcome by a sudden urge to abandon the whole affair. I had never really had a valid reason for supposing the girl would be on this ship. Suddenly it seemed neither sensible, nor even sane, to continue search based solely on vague surmise; particularly as my attitude to its object was so undefined. When I considered that imperative need I felt for her, as for a missing part of myself, it appeared less like love than an inexplicable aberration, the sign of some character flaw I ought to eradicate, instead of letting it dominate me.<br><br> At this moment a big black-backed gull sailed past, almost brushing my cheek with its wing tip, as if on purpose to draw my attention and eyes after it up to the boat deck. At once I saw her there, looking away from me, where no one had been before; and everything I had just been thinking was swept out of my head by a wave of excitement, my old craving for her returned. I was convinced it was she without even seeing her face; no other girl in the world had such dazzling hair, or was so thin that her fragility could be seen through a thick gray coat. I simply had to reach her, it was all I could think of. Envying the gull&#x2019;s effortless flight, I plunged straight into the solid mass of humanity separating me from her, and forced my way through. I had hardly any time, in a moment the boat would be sailing. Visitors were leaving already, forming a strong cross current I had to fight. My one idea was to get to the boat deck before it was too late. In my anxiety, I must have pushed people aside. Hostile remarks were made, a fist shaken. I tried to explain my urgency to those who obstructed me, but they would not listen. Three tough looking young men linked arms and aggressively barred my way, their expressions threatening. I had not meant to offend, hardly knew what I was doing. I was thinking only of her. Suddenly an official voice shouted through a loudspeaker: &#x201c;All visitors ashore! The gangway will be raised in exactly two minutes.&#x201d; The ship&#x2019;s siren sounded an ear-splitting blast. An immediate rush followed. It was quite impossible to resist the human flood surging toward the gangway. I was caught up in the stampede, dragged along with it, off the boat, and on to the quay.<br><br> Standing at the water&#x2019;s edge, I soon saw her high above me, considerably further off now. The ship had already moved away from the shore and was gathering speed every second, already divided from me by a strip of water too wide to jump. In desperation, I shouted and waved my arms, trying to attract her attention. It was hopeless. A whole sea of arms waved all around me, innumerable voices were shouting unintelligibly. I saw her turn to speak to somebody who had just joined her, at the same time pulling a hood over her head, so that her hair was hidden. Immediate doubts invaded me, and increased as I watched her. After all, perhaps she was not the right girl; she seemed too self-possessed. But I was not certain.<br><br> The boat was now beginning the turn that would bring it round facing the mouth of the harbor, leaving behind it a curving track of smoother water, like the swath left by a scythe. I stood staring after it, although cold had driven the passengers off the decks and there was no more hope of recognition. I dimly remembered what I had been thinking just before I caught sight of her, but only as one might recall an incident from a dream. Once again the urgency of the search had reclaimed me; I was totally absorbed in that obsessional need, as for a lost, essential portion of my own being. Everything else in the world seemed immaterial.</p><h2>People and Folks: Gangs, Crime, and the Underclass in a Rustbelt City</h2><p>Pages are clean and binding is tight.</p><p>Preface to the Second Edition. I wrote the first edition of People and Folks hoping that it might be "provocative" in the sense that it might "provoke" the reader to think in a new way about gangs. Conventional wisdom had it that the members of Milwaukee's youth gangs were merely young hoodlums. What I saw, however, were troubled youth growing up and acting out-often destructively-in a strange, new, post-industrial world. I argued that gangs were not just a "crime problem," but could only be understood in the context of economic restructuring. People and Folks was the first book to apply William Julius Wilson's work to the study of gangs. <p>I concluded in the first edition that deindustrialization was changing the rules for gang members, as for many others in poor communities. What would happen to the gang members we studied as the good jobs left? They didn't know and I didn't know as the first edition went to press. This new edition answers that question, and lets male and female gang members interpret their experience for the reader in their own words. </p><p>This edition adds a single rather long chapter that updates the reader on what happened to the people and folks as they became adults. I argue in this chapter that many of the new criminological studies on gangs-including the first edition of People and Folks-have three serious flaws: (1) They do not pay sufficient attention to female gangs or to the importance of gender for both males and females; (2) they underestimate the influence of mainstream culture on gang members and the underclass; and (3) they do not fully appreciate the extent and importance of the informal ("underground") economy for gangs and poor communities. As with earlier chapters, Chapter Eight uses the voices of gang members themselves to discuss these issues. Among the questions explored in these pages are how drug dealing has in many ways replaced industrial jobs in some poor communities, and how that change impacts gangs. I present some shocking statistics on the state of the formal and informal economy in Milwaukee. I also discuss how the lives of female gang members differ from the lives of male gang members. </p><p>You will note that the gang members in these pages do not worship some deviant code of the street, but have deeply internalized the good, the bad, and the ugliness of American culture. Mainstream American culture, I've learned, has had far more influence on gang members' outlook than the "social isolation" they face in segregated ghettoes. My fundamental conclusion is that underclass gang members differ from you and me not in their "culture" but in the different opportunities they face and the kinds of choices available to them. </p><p>This conclusion may run against the grain of some current criminological thinking. But the intention of People and Folks was to be provocative, and I don't think the second edition will disappoint anyone on that account. The perceptive reader may discover in my argument the beginnings of a new theoretical perspective on understanding gangs-one that incorporates anomie theory and feminism, along with some elements of social disorganization theory. I believe the post-industrial revolution may have consequences for the urban poor that are as sweeping as those brought about by the industrial revolution. I've concluded we may need new theory to account for these phenomena, but I have not attempted to do more than outline elements of a new approach here. </p><p>I have kept the term "underclass" in the title of the book. This word has become so controversial that even William Julius Wilson no longer uses it. Some see the word "underclass" as stigmatizing minority males or as a surrogate term for the "disreputable poor." Others use it in a strict statistical sense to describe a portion of the urban poor, while others use it vaguely to describe the victims of deindustrialization. This array of definitions of the term certainly makes us ask, like Alice in Wonderland, "whether you can make words mean so many different things?" </p><p>I agree with Wilson when he urges us not get hung up with words. But I'm also like Humpty Dumpty, who retorted to Alice, "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean-neither more nor less." What I mean by underclass are those people in poor communities who have been most affected by economic restructuring and are surviving by some combination of low wage jobs, welfare, and/or work in the informal economy. This work includes drug selling, which, I argue, is transforming the nature of the post-industrial gang. This "underclass" is a distinct new social formation, and it needs a descriptive term. </p><p>Just as the first edition of People and Folks was a joint effort with former Vicelord Perry Macon, this chapter was also collaborative. Jerome Wonders, Lavell Cox, Angelo Vega, Jorge Silva, Rita Lewis, Amelia Holloway, Dora Rodriguez, Frances Turlock, and Clint Holloway all accepted the awesome responsibility to interview 174 of their homeboys and homegirls and to convince them that research can be useful for them. I hope it will be. I have the greatest respect for how these young men and women transcended their gang experiences by becoming an integral part of a five-year social science research study. It was their constant questioning of what I thought I had found that taught me the most about gangs.</p>John M.

Lincoln: His Last 24 Hours</h2><p>Mystery and speculation have been associated with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln for more than a century. Here is a thorough documentation, based on 30 years of research, of the activities and struggles of the President during his last day, along with events leading up to the assassination. Eyewitness accounts, never-before-published facts, Booth&#x2019;s activities on April 14, the reaction of the city, physician&#x2019;s efforts&#x2014;and many other factors large and small are covered. A four-part appendix explains still unresolved mysteries surrounding this fascinating historical event. Photos are generally the rare and the little-seen, including a few never before published.</p><p>YA This short but scholarly book details those fateful hours of April 14, 1865. Every incident of the day is included, from the moment Lincoln arose until that evening when he died. Although basically a research book, it has a readable narrative style that sweeps readers along into the events of the day. Thus it should appeal to various types of students. Numerous illustrations, both photographs and drawings, add interest and realism. An appendix recounts some of the unsolved mysteries surrounding Lincoln's assassination. These include the suitability of his bodyguard that evening and the uncertainty of the autopsy findings. Extensive footnotes help to authenticate the material, and a lengthy bibliography documents the research.

Lindbergh, Lowell, Byrd, and Earhart are the dreamers; Michener, Heller, and Deighton are the recorders; Armstrong, Glenn, Scott, and McAuliffe are the visionaries. And as Yeager executes a "zero-g roll with a full load of rocket fuel," Poe marvels, "Who shall say that anything is impossible hereafter?"

The principles in this book are not theoretical. They have worked successfully in Jack Hartman&#x2019;s life and in the lives of many people who have followed these principles. Jack carefully points out the differences between the world&#x2019;s system of prosperity and God&#x2019;s laws of prosperity. He explains that all of the warnings in the Bible against financial prosperity are warnings against following the world&#x2019;s system of prosperity. God&#x2019;s Word clearly indicates that He does want us to prosper as long as this prosperity is achieved by following His laws of prosperity. These laws are laid out in detail in sixteen chapters of specific instruction -- every chapter filled with many verses of Scripture. The book closes with a unique &#x201c;test&#x201d; in which readers can test themselves on their knowledge of God&#x2019;s laws of prosperity. Jack Hartman believes that our economy is going to experience a definite down-turn and he urges all Christians to study and apply God&#x2019;s specific instructions for prosperity and success. God&#x2019;s laws of prosperity are not in any way dependent upon the condition of a man-made economic system. Now is the time to start learning and applying these laws.</p><p>Lamplight Ministries, Inc. began in Jack Hartman&#x2019;s insurance office in 1974. Jack was faced with increasing financial pressures. A friend had told him to ask Jesus Christ into his heart, to surrender his life to God, and to search the Bible for instructions about resolving the crisis in his life. Jack had already written two books on agency management with a special system of categorizing subject. Jack searched the Bible to find every Scripture about finances. He wrote the verses on 3x5 cards and carried them with him. He saturated himself in the Bible. He began to teach eight people in his office on Tuesday evenings. He made copies of his notes for the people to take with them. These notes became Lamplight&#x2019;s first books and tapes. <p>The Bible study grew so large that they had to meet in a hotel, then a junior high school, and finally purchased property for a church and a Christian school. Jack taught that Tuesday Bible study from 1975 through 1987. </p><p>Jack continues to gather Scripture on specific topics, developing Scripture cards, books, and tapes.

With a new perspective on life, Hap wants to change the way he's living, and shoot the straight and narrow. That is until the man who stole Leonard Pine's boyfriend turns up headless in a ditch and Leonard gets fingered for the murder. Hap vows to clear Leonard's name, but things only get more complicated when Leonard's ex shows up dead. To the police it is just a matter of gay-biker infighting, but to Hap and Leonard murder is always serious business, and these hit a little to close to home.</p></p><p>Hap Collins is in a LaBorde, Texas, hospital recuperating from an attack by a rabid squirrel and wondering why his best friend, Leonard Pine, hasn't been by to visit. Turns out that Leonard was upset enough about his boyfriend Raul leaving him for another guy that he went down to the biker bar this guy hangs out at and beats him with a broom handle. When the biker turns up dead later that night, it doesn't take long to guess who the primary suspect is--especially with Leonard nowhere to be found.<p> After Hap checks himself out of the hospital and finds Leonard hiding in his bed, the fourth novel in this series kicks into high gear--or what passes for high gear in Lansdale's deceptively laid-back storytelling style. Pretty soon, they've stumbled onto a conspiracy involving gaybasher pornography, and Leonard's ready to exact some vigilante justice over Hap's protestations: "There's few people think a roach exterminator is a murderer. I'm not talkin' about beatin' up and rapin' innocent people who are lookin' for love in all the wrong places. I'm talkin' about stampin' out a plague, man....

Spurred by the decline of its industrial cities and by mass suburbanization, people imagined a new national identity&#x2014;one that emphasized consumerism, social mobility, and a suburban lifestyle. The urbanity of the city was lost. In When America Became Suburban, Robert A. Beauregard examines this historic intersection of urban decline, mass suburbanization, domestic prosperity, and U.S. global aspirations as it unfolded from 1945 to the mid-1970s. Suburban expansion and the subsequent emergence of sprawling Sunbelt cities transformed every aspect of American society. Assessing the global implications of America&#x2019;s suburban way of life as evidence of the superiority of capitalist democracy, Beauregard traces how the suburban ideology enabled America to distinguish itself from both the Communist bloc and Western Europe, thereby deepening its claim of exceptionalism on the world-historical stage.Placing the decline of America&#x2019;s industrial cities and the rise of vast suburban housing and retail spaces into a cultural, political, and global context, Beauregard illuminates how these phenomena contributed to a changing notion of America&#x2019;s identity at home and abroad. When America Became Suburban brings to light the profound implications of de-urbanization: from the siphoning of investments from the cities and the effect on the quality of life for those left behind to a profound shift in national identity.Robert A. Beauregard is a professor in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation at Columbia University. He is the author of Voices of Decline: The Postwar Fate of U.S. Cities and editor of Economic Restructuring and Political Response and Atop the Urban Hierarchy.</p><p>Robert A. Beauregard is professor of urban planning in the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation, Columbia University. His writings have appeared in numerous professional journals including Environment &amp; Planning, Journal of Planning History, and Urban Studies.The core of this study by Beauregard, an author and Columbia University professor, is that the postwar emigration of wealthier populations from the cities led to thriving suburban centers while leaving urban populations poor and isolated. Spurred by the decreasing success of urban industrial centers, the suburban migration gave rise to a national mentality fueled by upward economic mobility and a corresponding lifestyle shift. Once he presents the generalized, easy-to-understand theory that declining cities mean big suburbs, Beauregard fills the rest of the book-tracking suburban growth from 1945 to the mid '70s-restating that theory with varying levels of verbosity. Many of the observations here are regurgitated, redundant or patently obvious: "With rare exceptions, cities add residents when their economies are expanding. An expanding economy, moreover, most often means that jobs are plentiful, incomes are rising and tax bases are growing." The book's subject is a worthy one, but this volume doesn't shed enough new light to make it worthwhile.

Yet this was only one of the thirty books she wrote, and it took just a few months of her remarkably active life to compose.<br><br>A woman of compelling personality and exceptional energy, Elspeth Huxley was not only a celebrated writer, but also a farmer, broadcaster, journalist, conservationist, political thinker, magistrate, and government adviser. She was a vivid chronicler of colonial Kenya, and became increasingly recognized as an observer and interpreter of African affairs over a period of profound change. Initially a staunch defender of the white settlers, she would later come to support moves toward African independence.<br><br>After a childhood spent in East Africa and wartime Britain, Elspeth married a grandson of Thomas Huxley and cousin of Aldous Huxley, whom she knew well. Her wide circle also later included George and Joy Adamson, the Leakeys, and Peter Scott (whose biography she wrote). Whatever their subject, her books reveal the adventurousness, warmth, perception, and occasional astringency that made up her own personality; they are also notable for their acute observation and great social range, encompassing the lives of Kenya&#x2019;s poor white farmers, the frivolous Happy Valley set, and Africans alike.<br><br>For this, the first biography of Elspeth Huxley, C. S. Nicholls has made extensive use of her papers and letters---including those to and from Elspeth&#x2019;s formidable mother Nellie and her hapless father Jos. <i>Elspeth Huxley: A Biography</i> is not merely a fascinating portrait of an extraordinary woman, but an absorbing account of an entire era of colonial and British history.<br></p><p>&#x201c;Delicious stories...I recommend this excellent biography to anybody who cares for Huxley's books and for Kenya.&#x201d;---Aiden Hartley, <i>Literary Review </i>[U.K.]<br><br>&#x201c;C.

Visit her online at www.LindsayMcKenna.com.<br><br>It was time. As she sat at her bedroom table in Montana, Kam Trayhern's hands grew damp. Outside her window, the May dusk turned a lush pink and orange above the Douglas firs surrounding the two-story Montana home of her adopted parents, Morgan and Laura Trayhern.<br><br>Now that she'd returned from a harrowing trip to Africa, she had to face the rest of her life, starting with her birth. Kam lifted a folder marked Tracy Elizabeth Fielding. She opened it and smoothed out the papers inside with trembling hands. She shouldn't be so emotional about this. But she was.<br><br>Her gaze fell upon the black-and-white photo that had haunted her for years. The edges were stained and darkened from age and damage from the earthquake that had hit Los Angeles twenty-eight years earlier. A marine dog handler and her golden retriever had found Kam and her biological mother in the debris of their destroyed apartment complex. That day, Kam's mother had died but she had lived, thanks to that marine, Callie Evans. Kam had been taken to Camp Reed on the Marine Corps base for treatment of her minor injuries.<br><br>Kam turned on the desk light to get a better look at the old photo. Just like that the dusk within the room disappeared, but nothing could make her nightmares disappear. She had to face facts. Morgan and Laura Trayhern had adopted her when they discovered she had no family. Her mother had been an orphan and there was no trace of her father. At the time of the quake, many records, memories and photos had been lost&#x2014;forever. All Kam had from the apartment was this photo. It had been found in her mother's purse.<br><br>The photo showed her mother, Elizabeth, with black curly hair like her own, standing with three men. She wore a white lab coat for a Los Angeles veterinary convention. Another vet stood next to her, smiling toothily for the photo. The note on the back identified the veterinary convention. A businessman in a dark gray suit stood on the other side. Kam's gaze drifted to the third man, the tallest one, to the left of her mother. He looked like a cowboy with his black Stetson. His weathered square face, a mustache and narrowed eyes spoke of the harsh elements, most likely from ranching.<br><br>How many times had Kam looked at this photo and wondered if one of these three men were her father? Kam frowned and peered more closely at the man standing with her mother. She felt an instinctive churn of her gut as she looked almost longingly at the cowboy. He stood out from the others. Taller than all of them, he was built lean, like a wolf. His face was darkly sunburned, deep creases and laugh lines showed at the corners of his eyes. Everyone in the photo was smiling except him. And her mother was caught looking in his direction. Was this a secret look of love?<br><br>A lump formed in Kam's throat. Of course, her adopted father, Morgan, had turned over every stone to find her biological father. After all, Morgan was in the security business at the highest levels of the government with his super-secret Perseus and Medusa companies. No one in the outside world knew what he did for a living. As a cover, Morgan had created a real-estate front to hide his real reasons for being in Phillipsburg, Montana. His secret offices were located deep below the basement level of the turn-of-the-century Victorian house. Kam had been raised in a two-story cedar home not far from the office.<br><br>Morgan had promised Kam to find every possible scrap of information on her mother, and over the years, he had. The questions remained: Who had fathered her? And why hadn't that man ever come forward to claim her? These questions cut like a knife. Because she owed Morgan and Laura everything, Kam had waited a long time to approach them about seeking her biological father herself. She simply did not want to hurt them. But now she couldn't put it off. She had decided to take a hiatus from her professional photography job as a stringer for several global newspapers and magazines. This way, she'd have the time and energy to conduct her search. And her parents had to know her plan.<br><br>Kam wiped her damp hands on the sides of her jeans. How would they react? Again, her gut tightened with fear. Would they be angry? Throw her out of the house that she had called home for twenty-eight years? Oh, it was true that she was a globetrotter and had come home only about once a year since turning twenty-one, but still... Kam dreaded the possibility that they would kick her out of their lives.<br><br>And then, where would she be? Without any family. Her mother had been an adopted child, and the people who had adopted her were dead along with whatever memories and information they had. It was the worst kind of ending for Kam&#x2014;to be an orphan of an orphan. What had she done to be a lost spirit in this lifetime? Kam believed in reincarnation, believed that her soul would never die, but that it would return lifetime after lifetime into different bodies to learn how to become a compassionate and spiritually enlightened human being.<br><br>Two of the few items retrieved from Elizabeth's destroyed apartment had been a book on Buddhism and one on reincarnation<em>. </em>These books were now dog-eared from being read so many times. Kam had wanted to adopt her mother's views on life and, to a degree, she had. Consequently, her beliefs were different from those of the Trayhern family. They didn't mind nor did they try to force her into their belief system.<br><br>It was time. Now was the time to focus and not dwell on the past. As scared as she was, Kam knew she had to initiate the search and conquer this fear. Why should she be afraid anyway? She was wise and worldly thanks to her career. Many times, she'd gone into war-torn and ravaged third-world countries to bring people's suffering and needs to the world's attention. Her photos had garnered her many awards over the years and she'd made more than enough money to take time off to hunt for her real father.<br><br>Taking a deep breath, Kam glanced down at the watch on her wrist. The family would sit down to dinner at 7:00 p.m., as always. She'd arrived three days earlier from her last assignment in Africa. Her mother, Laura, was throwing a party for her this weekend. Her brother Jason and his wife, Annie, and their children lived nearby and would attend. Kathy, one of the fraternal twins, had just married raptor rehabilitator, Sky McCoy. They, too, would be at her return celebration dinner.<br><br>Knowing her father would be home by now, Kam decided to talk with him first. Morgan always had a glass of red wine and relaxed from the day's pressures before dinner in the airy library. Standing up, Kam rubbed her knotted stomach. Above all, she didn't want to upset Morgan and Laura. They were the last people she ever wanted to hurt. Torn because she loved them deeply, she sighed.<br><br>Kam picked up the photo and headed downstairs. Classical music wafted through the cathedral roof of the cedar home. She smelled basil and knew her mother was probably cooking up a pesto sauce to go with some Italian dish. If only Kam had an appetite.<br><br>Her father sat in the study surrounded on three sides by floor-to-ceiling shelves of books. He was in his favorite burgundy leather chair reading. Her heart blossomed with a fierce love for this man. Never had he or Laura ever treated her as anything but their treasured daughter. He lifted his head and a smiled with welcome as she entered the room. She noted he was graying at the temples, but his hair still gleamed black beneath the stained-glass lamp suspended above him.<br><br>"Hi, Dad," she greeted, her voice hoarse and wavering.<br><br>"Kam. Well, are you finally caught up on sleep and out of the jet lag?"<br><br>She forced a smile she didn't feel and brought up an upholstered burgundy stool. "Yeah, I think I've left Africa behind."<br><br>Morgan closed his book and gave her an assessing look. "Is something wrong? You seem upset."<br><br>"I could never hide a thing from you, could I?" She managed a strangled chuckle. Her hands shook slightly as she nervously held the picture between them.<br><br>Morgan took a sip of his wine and placed the glass back on the cherry lamp table next to his chair. "No," he murmured, giving her a softened look. "What are you holding?"<br><br>Kam was forever surprised by Morgan's keen alertness. He always knew when something was on her mind. "What? Oh this..." Her mouth grew dry and the fear amped up so much that she felt nearly suffocated. She held out the photo to him. "Dad, you remember this picture they took from my mom's purse after I was rescued?"<br><br>Frowning, Morgan studied the photo. "Yes, I do, Kam." Softening his tone, he added, "What have you decided to do?"<br><br>Kam cleared her throat. "Dad, I think that one of these men might be my biological father." She rushed on when his brows raised. "I know this probably sounds silly and far-fetched but my gut instinct tells me this. I&#x2014;I want the chance to find out. I want to take the next year off and run down the leads."<br><br>Nodding, Morgan rested his elbows on the arms of the chair and clasped his hands. "It's time, Kam. Laura and I were wondering when you would begin the long, hard journey to try and find your father."<br><br>"You did?" Her voice sounded thin and stretched. Heart pounding furiously in her breast, she lowered her eyes. "I don't want to hurt you, Dad. Or Mom. I&#x2014;I know this has to be painful for both of you."<br><br>"Baby girl," Morgan whispered, reaching out to her, "we expected you someday to try to locate the man who made it possible for you to be in our life." He gave her a quick squeeze on the shoulders and released her. "You're human, Kam. Every person wants to know who their mother and father are. You're no different." He tousled her short hair. "Frankly, we were concerned because you didn't seem to want to go on that journey. We know you wear your heart on your sleeve. And we know how sensitive you are toward all living things. We felt you just hadn't built up enough of a desire to go after him yet. I'm glad this moment has come, Kam. For you."<br><br>Blinking through sudden, hot tears, Kam absorbed Morgan's quick embrace. It was filled with such love and caring. "I&#x2014;I just don't want to lose you two."<br><br>"You won't ever lose us, Kam," Morgan assured her, his voice growing raspy.<br><br>Kam searched his blue-gray eyes and saw tears. "You've given me so much. You are so generous, kind and caring...."<br><br>"And we'll always be that way with you, Kam. When you love someone, that never changes. Time only deepens love. And that's how we feel about you. I'm sure Laura will be glad to hear your plans."<br><br>Just like that, Kam's heart stopped racing and she felt more at peace. "So, you really think Mom will be okay with this?"<br><br>Morgan chuckled and sat back in his chair. "If I know her, she'll want to help you find your birth father. Listen to me, Kam. All we want is for you to be happy. We know how much it means to have those few items from your mother's apartment. Parents are bedrock for a child. They tell you where you came from, what kind of person loved you enough to have you. And now, you need to find your birth father."<br><br>"He's never come to find me..." Kam choked. Tears blurred her vision for a moment. "You don't know how many nights I lay up there in my bed wondering why he never came to see me. I&#x2014;I have had so many nightmares about this, Dad. That he didn't want me..."<br><br>The words were terrible to say. To admit. Kam thought them often, but to say them out loud was like having a weight sit on her that she could no longer avoid or dodge. She saw Morgan's face twist with concern.<br><br>"Kammie, don't go there. At least, not yet. What if he didn't know about you?"<br><br>"I've run through that scenario," Kam admitted.<br><br>"But if that was so, why didn't my mother contact him? Tell him she was pregnant with me? Why didn't he return to her life and take the responsibility?"<br><br>Shrugging, Morgan said gently, "We won't know those answers until you find him and confront him."<br><br>She pressed a hand to her chest. "I just get so envious of people who know who their birth moms and dads are. I ache inside because I don't. I just feel this huge hole in my heart and there's nothing that can really fill it except to know who my father is."<br><br>"I know," Morgan whispered, a catch in his tone. Reaching out, he squeezed Kam's hand. "One step at a time, baby girl. When we have dinner tonight, let your mom know what you want to do. I'll bet she can help."<br><br>Nodding, Kam clung to his hand. Morgan Trayhern was a giant in the military and spy business. His reputation was one of respect, integrity and admiration. This man, who was so powerful, was also her dad, the man who had raised her with nothing but love. Kam knew how lucky she was, and, as she sat there clinging to his grip, she understood that her biological father would never meet his stature of this man.<br><br>Laura and Morgan sat with Kam after the dinner table had been cleared.<br><br></p><h2>Boys Over Flowers, Vol. 15</h2><p>Born into a middle class family and considered poor compared to her wealthy classmates, typical teenager Tsukushi Makino deals with life, love, and new classmates after she is accepted into the prestigious Eitoku academy.</p><p></p><h2>PIPPO Tom and Pippo and the Washing Machine</h2><p>Early reader/picture book.

Johnson regarding the Kennedy assassination and its aftermath.<br><br>The transition from John F. Kennedy to Johnson was arguably the most wrenching and, ultimately, one of the most bitter in the nation&#x2019;s history. As Johnson himself said later, &#x201c;I took the oath, I became president. But for millions of Americans I was still illegitimate, a naked man with no presidential covering, a pretender to the throne....The whole thing was almost unbearable.&#x201d;<br><br>In this book, Max Holland, a leading authority on the assassination and longtime Washington journalist, presents the momentous telephone calls President Johnson made and received as he sought to stabilize the country and keep the government functioning in the wake of November 22, 1963. The transcripts begin on the day of the assassination, and reveal the often chaotic activity behind the scenes as a nation in shock struggled to come to terms with the momentous events. The transcripts illuminate Johnson&#x2019;s relationship with Robert F. Kennedy, which flared instantly into animosity; the genuine warmth of his dealings with Jacqueline Kennedy; his contact with the FBI and CIA directors; and the advice he sought from friends and mentors as he wrestled with the painful transition. <br><br>We eavesdrop on all the conversations&#x2013;including those with leading journalists&#x2013;that persuaded Johnson to abandon his initial plan to let Texas authorities investigate the assassination. Instead, we observe how he abruptly established a federal commission headed by a very reluctant chief justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren. We also learn how Johnson cajoled and drafted other prominent men&#x2013;among them Senator Richard Russell (who detested Warren), Allen Dulles, John McCloy, and Gerald Ford&#x2013;into serving. <br><br>We see a sudden president under unimaginable pressure, contending with media frenzy and speculation on a worldwide scale. We witness the flow of inaccurate information&#x2013;some of it from J. Edgar Hoover&#x2013;amid rumors and theories about foreign involvement. And we glimpse Johnson addressing the mounting criticism of the Warren Commission after it released its still-controversial report in September 1964. <br><br>The conversations rendered here are nearly verbatim, and have never been explained so thoroughly. No passages have been deleted except when they veered from the subject. Brought together with Holland&#x2019;s commentaries, they make riveting, hugely revelatory reading.</p><p>"<b>The Kennedy Assassination Tapes</b> fills a significant hole in our understanding of Lyndon Johnson's response to John F. Kennedy's assassination. The book is a welcome antidote to the assertions about LBJ's involvement in JFK's death.

The poems move from the magic of childhood&#x2014;bostin fittle at Nanny&#x2019;s, summers before school&#x2014;into deeper, darker territory: sensual love, enchanted weddings, and the promise of new life. In Berry&#x2019;s hands, the ordinary is transformed: her characters shift shapes, her eye is unusual, her ear attuned to the sounds of the Black Country, with "vowels ferrous as nails, consonants / you could lick the coal from." Ablaze with energy, and full of the rich dialect of the West Midlands, this is an incandescent debut from a poet of dazzling talent and verve.</p></p><p><b>Liz Berry</b> received an Eric Gregory Award, an Arvon-Jerwood Mentorship, and she is the author of a pamphlet, <i>The Patron Saint of Schoolgirls</i>.

She works as an infant school teacher and is the assistant poetry editor at <i>Ambit</i> magazine.&#34;Black Country is an extraordinary debut...rooted in place. When you close the book, you can still see the Black Country in your mind&#39;s eye, as if all the poems in it were coming together to form a continuous landscape, a single yet varied view. These poems need to be studied slowly yet there is, as one reads on, a sense of gathering speed, a flightiness, a readiness to soar... She writes, in the best sense, on a wing and a prayer. What marks out this writing is its sparing but assured use of Midlands dialect. This is writing of warmth, maturity and intermittent eroticism. Liz Berry knows her own flight-path, that is for sure.&#34; -- Kate Kellaway * Observer * &#34;Superb... a sooty, soaring hymn to her native West Midlands, scattered with words of dialect that light up the lines like lamps.

Reprint.</p><p>Howard Melvin Fast (11 November 1914, New York City - 12 March 2003, Old Greenwich, Connecticut) was a Jewish American novelist and television writer, who wrote also under the pen names E. V. Cunningham and Walter Ericson.An unexpected sixth novel in Fast's Immigrants saga, issued 12 years after the fifth (and supposedly final) installment, The Immigrant's Daughter (1985). Once again, the protagonist is Barbara Lavette, now 68 and the matriarch of a large and successful California clan. Barbara has always been the archetypal activist (having been, variously, a labor organizer in the 1930s, an adventurous reporter in the 1940s, a defiant victim of the House Un-American Activities Committee in the 1950s, and a vigorous supporter of the struggles of blacks and women for equal rights, as well as an opponent of the Vietnam War), and this time out she takes on the case of a young black man she believes has been unfairly treated by the police. She also, to the astonishment of her friends and family, marries again. But her continuing battles for justice, and her honeymoon, are cut short by the news that she has developed cancer. Not much happens here--there are a good many amiable meals, fond chat between family members, a discreet courtship, and the name-dropping and walk-ons by the famous that have always been a part of the series--and the ending would seem to suggest that this really is the conclusion of the saga. A muted, somewhat puzzling, addenda to a lively (and successful) series. (First printing of 100,000) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Unexpurgated Sea Chanties</h2><p>"Now seamen who spent their time in cargo-carrying sailing ships never heard a decent shanty; the words which sailor John put to them when unrestrained were the veriest filth." <br>--Master Mariner W.B. Whall <p>Compiled and annotated by a longtime Naval officer and author of the acclaimed thriller Tiger Cruise, this unexpurgated collection of genuine sea chanteys is not for small children, but it's an unrestrained look into another side of military life and literature. </p><p>Sung for as long as sailors have gone to the sea in ships, chanteys helped to make shipboard tasks easier and to pass the time on years-long voyages. Each generation of sailors adapted the songs to their own needs and cultures, forming an unbroken link from the nuclear-powered navies of today to the age of sail. </p><p>Annotated with explanations of Naval terms and life--including some of the bawdier parts of a sailor's life--What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor? is a delight for both history and music buffs, as well as an offbeat gift for people with naval backgrounds.</p></p><p>Douglas Morgan spent many years in the Navy before finishing up his doctorate and turning to--among other things--a writing career, and he&#39;s still never far from the sea, at least metaphorically. There have been many collections of sea chanties, but very few of them print the chanties the way they are actually sung, or put them into the context of the Naval and maritime traditions in which they are created. Every one of these songs was actually sung at sea, on the ships where Douglas Morgan served. His marvelous annotations lay out the background, people, terms, and places that the songs celebrate, as well as showing how they still fit into today&#39;s Navy. Despite Doug&#39;s academic background, his annotations aren&#39;t dry commentaries on dead folklore; they are filled with jokes, intra-service barbs, variant songs, bizarre people, and everything else readers need to understand--or relive, for fellow sailors--what is still a vital, growing body of music, sung in hundreds of variants on hundreds of ships to this day.Douglas Morgan spent years in the US Navy first as an enlisted man, and later as an officer. Along the way he sailed every major body of water where the US Navy can fit a ship, picked up an incredible amount of folklore--very little of which can be printed in family oriented publications--and an advanced degree in English literature. He is the author of Tiger Cruise, a military thriller involving Indonesian pirates who hijack an American destroyer carrying nuclear arms.

It is a conflict that has never been acknowledged and a story that has never been told.</p><p>This surreptitious war began with the Iranian revolution and simmers today inside Iraq and in the Persian Gulf. Fights rage in the shadows, between the CIA and its network of spies and Iran's intelligence agency. Battles are fought at sea with Iranians in small speedboats attacking Western oil tankers. This conflict has frustrated five American presidents, divided administrations, and repeatedly threatened to bring the two nations into open warfare. It is a story of shocking miscalculations, bitter debates, hidden casualties, boldness, and betrayal.</p><p>A senior historian for the federal government with unparalleled access to senior officials and key documents of several U.S. administrations, Crist has spent more than ten years researching and writing <i>The Twilight War</i>, and he breaks new ground on virtually every page. Crist describes the series of secret negotiations between Iran and the United States after 9/11, culminating in Iran's proposal for a grand bargain for peace-which the Bush administration turned down. He documents the clandestine counterattack Iran launched after America's 2003 invasion of Iraq, in which thousands of soldiers disguised as reporters, tourists, pilgrims, and aid workers toiled to change the government in Baghdad and undercut American attempts to pacify the Iraqi insurgency. And he reveals in vivid detail for the first time a number of important stories of military and intelligence operations by both sides, both successes and failures, and their typically unexpected consequences.</p><p>Much has changed in the world since 1979, but Iran and America remain each other's biggest national security nightmares. "The Iran problem" is a razor-sharp briar patch that has claimed its sixth presidential victim in Barack Obama and his administration. <i>The Twilight War</i> adds vital new depth to our understanding of this acute dilemma it is also a thrillingly engrossing read, animated by a healthy irony about human failings in the fog of not-quite war.</p></p><p><b>Dr. David Crist</b> is a senior historian for the federal government and frequent adviser to senior government officials on the Middle East.

Reprinted by arrangement of Penguin Press, a member of Penguin Group (USA), Inc. Copyright (c) 2012 by David Crist.</b></p><p>The twilight hours hold special significance in warfare. Your eyes are not acclimated to the changing light, and normal body cycles make soldiers less alert. I had this drilled into me as an aspiring marine corps officer. As dusk approached following a day of trudging around the woods of Quantico, Virginia, the last hour spent struggling to dig a fighting hole through a maze of roots with a small folding shovel that was frustratingly inadequate for the task, a captain suddenly hollered, &#x201c;Stand to!&#x201d; As the setting sun cast long shadows across the forest, I dropped into my partially dug pit and pointed my rifle out into the brush and trees. &#x201c;You are always most vulnerable to enemy attack during the periods of morning nautical twilight and evening nautical twilight,&#x201d; the instructor said, as part of a well- rehearsed lesson on tactics. &#x201c;Dusk and dawn are transition periods,&#x201d; he continued, with matter-of-fact delivery.</p><p>In 1987, when I attended the Basic School, a six- month- long school mandatory for all newly minted marine second lieutenants, many officers and senior enlisted had served in Vietnam. The lessons of that conflict, where the Vietcong frequently struck during twilight hours, had been seared into the collective memory of the service. Although with current technology a modern military can attack even on moonless nights or at the peak of the midday sun, the idea remains a valid military tactic. In July 2008, one of the worst attacks inflicted on the U.S. Army occurred just as the first hint of light appeared in the eastern sky of Afghanistan, when the Taliban struck a remote outpost, killing and wounding thirty- six soldiers. While no one attacked us during the training exercise in Quantico, the point stuck with me.</p><p>Twilight is an accurate metaphor for the current state of affairs between the United States and Iran. With no diplomatic ties and only occasional meetings in dark corners of hotel bars and through shadowy intermediaries, neither side has an accurate view of the other. The United States lacks clarity about Iranian leaders and the complex structure of the Iranian government. Meanwhile, Iran grows increasingly isolated and ignorant about the United States. This gray zone is dangerous. The threat of miscalculation is great and the military consequences can be grave. For three decades, the two nations have been suspended between war and peace. At various times, relations have moved from the light of peace to the darkness of war. But in the end, 2012 still looks remarkably like 1979, with the two nations still at loggerheads.</p><p>Both countries bear some culpability for perpetuating this conflict. The Iranian Revolution was born from anti- Americanism. The leaders who spearheaded that movement thirty years ago remain in power and see little need to change their stance. Hard liners in Iran reject the status quo of American supremacy in the region. With each chant of &#x201c;Death to America,&#x201d; they hope to reinvigorate the same fervor that swept them into power and tossed out an unpopular dictator, the shah of Iran, who had been imposed by the United States in a coup in 1953. While in this conflict the United States remains largely the good guy, it has not always been the perfect guy. Both Bush administrations dismissed Iranian goodwill gestures and refused to accept any dialogue that addressed Iran&#x2019;s legitimate security concerns. The United States supported Saddam Hussein and his Arab bankrollers in a bloody war against the Islamic Republic that killed several hundred thousand Iranian soldiers. The mantra of regime change remains a frequent slogan in many quarters in Washington. Unfortunately, Iran&#x2019;s response to these trespasses has invariably been to use the tools of the terrorist: an exploding car bomb on a crowded street or a plot to kill a diplomat in a popular Washington restaurant.</p><p>The research for this book, which included more than four hundred interviews, started in 1994 when I first traveled to the Tampa headquarters of CENTCOM to speak with officers charged with running this Iranian cold war from a worn, mazelike building at MacDill Air Force Base. I traveled to the backstreets of south Lebanon Shia neighborhoods and to the posh capitals of the Persian Gulf states interviewing Iranians and Arabs involved in the story. I went through my father&#x2019;s papers and then the first of many linear feet of other personal papers and official records.</p><p>While the focus of the book changed as time passed and history continued to unfold, the essence of the story has remained: the two countries have been engaged in a largely unknown quasi-war since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. Six different American presidents have faced a seemingly intractable foe in Tehran. Each had a defining event that pushed the two countries like a pinball back and forth between rapprochement and war. What I found myself involved in on that April morning in the northern Gulf was the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of this shadowy conflict.</p><p>This story continues to unfold. As of this writing, Iran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, and the two countries seem headed to the dark side of military conflict over Iran&#x2019;s nuclear program. The saga is seemingly playing on an endless loop. After reading one recent memo outlining the Bush administration&#x2019;s policies toward building an Arab coalition against Iran, as I relayed to the marine deputy commander at CENTCOM, John Allen, I could have interchanged the memo for one that had been written twenty- five years earlier as his predecessor grappled with the same enduring challenge of Iran. Iran&#x2019;s quest for nuclear technology has heightened the stakes and the tension but it has not been a catalyst for the conflict.</p><p>I have tried to tell the most accurate and complete story I could of this three- decade- long conflict between Iran and the United States. The story begins with the seminal events of the Iranian Revolution that decisively turned the two countries from allies to adversaries and continues to the stories behind the headlines of today&#x2019;s newspaper. The ideas presented in this book are my own and do not represent the views of the Department of Defense or the U.S. government.</p><p>The experienced American diplomat Ryan Crocker said to me in an interview, &#x201c;For Iran, there is no such thing as history; it is all still the present. We are the most ahistorical and they are the most historical&#x201d; of nations. In telling this story, I hope to rectify this fact. It is a story in which I have been a participant, dispassionate scholar, and, most recently, an adviser to senior Defense Department officials. It is a war of the shadows, largely unknown, arguably the most important and least understood conflict in recent history. It is the twilight war.</p></p><h2>Overcoming Speechlessness: A Poet Encounters the Horror in Rwanda, Eastern Congo, and Palestine/Israel</h2><p>In 2006, Alice Walker, working with Women for Women International, visited Rwanda and the eastern Congo to witness the aftermath of the genocide in Kigali. Invited by Code Pink, an antiwar group working to end the Iraq War, Walker traveled to Palestine/Israel three years later to view the devastation on the Gaza Strip. Here is her testimony.<br>Bearing witness to the depravity and cruelty, she presents the stories of the individuals who crossed her path and shared their tales of suffering and courage. Part of what has happened to human beings over the last century, she believes, is that we have been rendered speechless by unusually barbaric behavior that devalues human life. We have no words to describe what we witness. Self-imposed silence has slowed our response to the plight of those who most need us, often women and children, but also men of conscience who resist evil but are outnumbered by those around them who have fallen victim to a belief in weapons, male or ethnic dominance, and greed.</p><p>Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, ALICE WALKER is the author of more than thirty books including The Color Purple and Sent by Earth. Her writings have been translated into more than two dozen languages. From her essays concerning the civil rights movement to her cries for intervention on the Gaza Strip, Walker continually and eloquently calls attention to ignored injustices around the world.Following visits to Rwanda in 2006 on behalf of Women for Women International, Walker was nearly overcome with the aftermath of the genocidal violence, particularly aimed at women and children. On behalf of the antiwar group Code Pink, she traveled to the Gaza Strip in 2009 to witness the suffering caused by the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. In this slim volume, she tells the stories of women and children brutalized by war. She recalls visiting villages reduced to rubble, listening to women mourn the death of their children, sharing modest meals, and sharing stories of her own struggles growing up in the South, the U.S. civil rights movement, and learning the importance of connections to friends and family. She links modern-day atrocities to older cruelties, including the Holocaust and the Trail of Tears. Finding resilience in the midst of atrocities, Walker uses her own voice, as poet and activist, to speak out against injustices in the world&#x2019;s trouble spots. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>LEGO City: Need for Speed!</h2><p>There's never a dull moment in LEGO(R) City, especially when you there's a race full of monster trucks, racecars, and more!<br><br>A new LEGO(R) City race-themed adventure 6x9, featuring monster trucks, racecars, hilarious antics, and even a bear on a bicycle!

French troops withdrew in order to avoid a battle and the potential destruction of their capital. It wasn't long before German tanks rumbled past the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs Elysees to the Place de la Concorde.</p><p>The American community in Paris was the largest in Continental Europe, totalling approximately 30,000 before the Second World War. Although Ambassodor Bullitt advised those without vital business in the city to leave in 1939, over half of the Americans in Paris chose to stay.

Sherryl is best known for her ability to creating endearing small town communities and families. She is the New York Times and USA Today bestselling author of over 75 romances for Silhouette Desire and Special Edition.Tt was all because of that blasted bridal bouquet, Caitlyn Winters thought as she stared in dismay at the positive pregnancy test in her hand. From the moment she'd caught the bouquet at Jenny Collins's Christmas wedding in New York a little over a year ago, she'd been doomed. That instinctive grab of an object flying straight at her had changed her life.<br><br>Her twin sister, Carrie, who'd all but shoved her aside to try to snatch the bouquet from the air, was going to laugh herself silly at what had transpired since that night. So were the rest of the O'Briens, for that matter. They loved irony.<br><br>Noah Mcllroy, the family medicine resident whom she'd met soon after the wedding and with whom she'd been having a serious relationship since last September, tapped on the bathroom door.<br><br>"Caitlyn, are you okay?"<br><br>A hysterical laugh bubbled up, but she fought to contain it. This was no laughing matter. "Fine," she managed to squeak out just as the door opened. Noah's gaze shifted from her face to land on the test strip she was holding. Concern immediately evolved into astonishment.<br><br>"You're pregnant?" he asked, his eyes filled with surprise, but a smile already tugging at his lips.<br><br>His wonderful, sensual lips, which had gotten them into this mess, she thought wryly. Of course, she was well aware those lips hadn't caused her pregnancy. Heck, she'd known about the birds and bees long before that, thanks to all the romances in Chesapeake Shores and among her amorous O'Brien relatives.<br><br>But it was her inability to resist Noah's heated kisses that had led to all the rest. That and an apparently defective condom. Given her cautious nature, she probably should have insisted on at least three methods of birth control, but no, she'd trusted Noah when he'd assured her that the condoms would be sufficient.<br><br>The man had cast a spell over her from the minute they'd met, literally one week after she'd caught that blasted romantic bouquet with all its superstition attached like streamers of satin ribbon. The deft catch had earned hoots of laughter from her family and a stunned, disappointed scowl from her twin, who'd been angling for the bouquet all evening.<br><br>And now, here she was, barely more than a year later, and pregnant. She hadn't even accepted Noah's repeated pleas that they live together, even though he was in her apartment more often than he was in his own. She'd drawn a line at that, knowing that she'd never be able to keep his presence in her life a secret from her nosy family if they were actually living under the same roof.<br><br>And she'd wanted to keep this relationship a secret. After all, she was supposed to be the grounded, goaloriented sister. Carrie was the one everyone had expected to fall madly in love and marry before her college graduation. Instead, Carrie was jetting around the world, leading a completely carefree life, building a career in public relations for a big fashion designer and tossing away men like used tissues while she pined for one unobtainable man. And Caitlyn, thanks to that bouquet, was standing here with a positive pregnancy test in her hand!<br><br>She recalled the forget-me-nots that her aunt Bree had tucked into Jenny's simple bridal bouquet and fought back another hysterical laugh. She was hardly likely to forget this moment, that's for sure.<br><br>She drew in a deep breath and finally dared to meet Noah's gaze. For a man supposedly as dedicated to his medical career as she was to hers, he looked awfully pleased about this unexpected bump in the road. Of course, he was just a couple of months away from launching his career, while she still had the long years of an internship and residency to complete.<br><br>"Wipe that smile off your face," she instructed him firmly. "This is not good news."<br><br>His smile only spread, revealing that appealing dimple that had also sucked her right in. "It's the best possible news," he contradicted.<br><br>"Noah, you may see the light at the end of the tunnel, but be real. You'll finish your residency at the end of June and you still have to decide where you want to go into practice and get established. I haven't even started my internship. We might not even be living in the same city a few months from now. A baby doesn't fit into the plan."<br><br>"You know what they say," he began.<br><br>"Don't you dare remind me that God laughs while we're making plans."<br><br>She frowned for emphasis as she passed him on her way into the bedroom, where she sank down on the side of the bed. Maybe if she sat for a minute, she could think. Thinking clearly had always been her best trait.<br><br>She'd known what she wanted for her life by her teens. After spending a summer volunteering in a doctor's office in a medically underserved community in Appalachia and seeing reports about villages in third-world countries that were even worse off, she'd found her calling. Her reward had been the healthy children who'd clustered around her at the end of the summer to say goodbye, the moms who'd hugged her with tears in their eyes.<br><br>Just like her ambitious mother, Abby O'Brien Winters Riley, Caitlyn had thought her future through very carefully. There would be college, medical school, an internship and residency. Then she'd use all that knowledge to help children in parts of the world where medical help was severely lacking. She'd make a difference, just like everyone else in her family had in their own way. This was her way to shine, to live up to all those family expectations and at the same time do the kind of meaningful work she'd been born to do.<br><br>She'd been so focused that she'd managed to complete college in three years, then set out to whip through medical school and all of her rotations as fast as they'd allowed her to. Every summer she'd either crammed in more courses or served in another needy community, most recently in Africa with the Red Cross. While Carrie was the social butterfly, Caitlyn had been driven, not allowing a single distraction. Not until Noah, anyway.<br><br>She glanced up at him as he studied her with a worried expression. He was so incredibly gorgeous, it was little wonder that her heart seemed to stop whenever she looked at him. But it wasn't his looks that had made her fall in love. He'd seemed as driven as she was, determined to be the kind of old-fashioned doctor who was more concerned with treating his patients with compassion and dignity than racking up huge bucks on office visits and unnecessary testing.<br><br>They'd met on her rotation through the family medicine service right after that fateful wedding. She'd been immediately smitten by his dedication, the thoughtful kindness he displayed to everyone from patients to the most inept medical students still struggling to adapt book learning to practical experience. He'd turned her into a better doctor by example, no question about it. He'd suggested she waver from her original intention to focus on pediatrics and steered her into choosing family medicine. He'd helped her see that she could serve even more people with that well-rounded specialty.<br><br>Until she'd worked with him, she'd understood everything in her textbooks, but she hadn't mastered the instinctive diagnostic skills that made the difference between being competent and excelling. He'd taught her to listen to more than a list of symptoms, to hear what her patients weren't saying, as much as to what they said.<br><br>By fall, when she'd started her final year of medical school, they were in an exclusive relationship, stealing time to be together whenever they could. With their competing, demanding schedules, those stolen moments had been few and far between. Given the test strip she was holding, they'd been more than sufficient to alter her life apparently.<br><br>Noah dropped down beside her now and took her hand in his. "We're going to be okay," he said softly, his warm brown eyes filled with tenderness.<br><br>When she didn't answer, he touched her chin. "Look at me, Cait." Only after she'd turned her head, fighting tears, did he repeat, "We're going to be okay."<br><br>"How?" she asked him, unable to imagine it, unable to accept his confidently spoken reassurance.<br><br>"We'll get married," he said without hesitation. "I know we haven't talked about that yet, but you know I love you. I want a future with you. This just bumps up the timetable. I'm all but finished with my residency. I'll go into practice in July. You'll finish your internship and residency. Then you can join me in the practice."<br><br>She listened to the logical simplicity of his plan and regarded him incredulously, panicked by the certainty in his voice.<br><br>"That's <em>your</em> dream, Noah. Not mine. You know what I want, what I've worked so hard for. There's a big world out there in desperate need of medical help. I want to save the lives of babies in third-world countries who might not make it without a doctor in their village. The two weeks I spent in Africa last year..." Her voice trailed off and hitched as she thought about the desperation she'd seen everywhere she'd turned. "That time confirmed everything for me. I was meant to do that kind of work. I promised I'd be back."<br><br>To his credit he didn't dismiss her dream or the promise she'd made. They'd talked about it often enough. He knew how much it meant to her to go where she was needed. It was what she'd stayed up nights studying for. She'd known it from the first time she'd seen those malnourished children with their wide desperate eyes on the news. Every volunteer assignment she'd taken after that had only solidified her resolve.<br><br>"Then how do you see this going?" he asked quietly.<br><br>She wanted to blurt out that she'd have to end the pregnancy, but how could she? While she might believe in every woman's right to choose, she knew she'd never be able to live with herself if she chose abortion. She was a healer. And this was Noah's baby, an unexpected blessing under any other circumstances.<br><br>"I don't know," she whispered, hot tears falling.<br><br>Noah pulled her into his arms and held her against his chest, surrounding her with his strength and heat and that scary, unwavering certainty. "We'll figure it out," he promised. "Together, we'll figure out what's best."<br><br>For just an instant, Caitlyn allowed herself to believe that. She desperately wanted to hold on to the possibility that there was an answer that worked for both of them. But in every scenario she envisioned, she lost.<br><br>Noah knew a baby wasn't in Cait's plans, not right now, anyway. It killed him to see her so utterly miserable when he wanted to shout his joy from the rooftop. The timing might be lousy in so many ways, but the news filled him with hope that this child would bind the two of them together forever.<br><br>She'd been right about one thing: marriage and sharing a medical practice <em>was</em> his dream. He'd wanted that from the minute she'd started on his service at the hospital with her exhaustive textbook knowledge of medicine, her instinctive diagnostic skills that even now she didn't recognize that she possessed and her unquenchable thirst to learn everything he had to teach her. Her silky skin and untamed red curls had captivated him, too, no question about it. Every male at the hospital stared after her as she bounced through her days with boundless energy and optimism, spreading smiles in her wake.<br><br>Over the next few weeks they'd shared enough late nights and coffee it was a wonder either of them had ever slept a wink with all that caffeine racing through their systems. He'd never been much of a talker, but with Caitlyn, he hadn't been able to keep quiet. There'd been so much he'd wanted to share, so many things about her he'd wanted to learn.<br><br>She'd made him laugh with her endless stream of stories about her large Irish-American family and teased him unmercifully because his own background was Scottish. She'd claimed she could never take him home because of it.<br><br>He'd thought at the time she was joking, but now he couldn't help wondering. They'd been inseparable for most of the past year, but he still hadn't been invited to Chesapeake Shores, which wasn't that far away. Was he wrong about how much he meant to her? Was he only someone with whom she could spend time until the day she finished her residency and went off to begin her "real" life? Did she view him as safe, someone she could leave behind without regrets?<br><br>No, he thought heatedly. He wasn't wrong about their feelings. He couldn't be. He wasn't the only one in love. Cait loved him, too. He might not have a lot of experience with serious relationships&#x2014;how many doctors had enough time to properly date during all those years of school and training, after all?&#x2014;but he could recognize that what he'd found with Cait was special.<br><br>Sitting across the room on the edge of the bed where she'd left him, he watched her now as she pulled her strawberry-red hair into a severe knot intended to tame the curls. He smiled as a few escaped to brush her cheeks. It reminded him of the way she lived her life, desperately trying to control everything, but a wild streak coming out when she least expected it. He could recall with total clarity the last time she'd cut loose with total abandon. He liked imagining that was the night this baby had been conceived, with neither of them thinking of anything but each other.<br><br>"Cait," he said softly. "I think it's time I meet this crazy family of yours."<br><br>In her mirrored reflection, he saw her eyes go wide with alarm.<br><br>"Now?"<br><br>"Can you think of a better time? They have to be told about what's going on."<br><br>She shook her head. "Not a chance, Noah. Not until we know what we're going to do. Maybe not even then. My mom, she's great. She'll handle this okay. My great-grandmother&#x2014;"<br><br>"Nell O'Brien, right?"</p><h2>When Old Men Die: A Truman Smith Mystery (Walker Mystery)</h2><p>Truman Smith is happily fishing off a Galveston pier when his friend Dino seeks him out and asks for some help: Outside Harry, an old-timer with connections to Dino's family, is missing.<br>Smith doesn't want to have anything to do with it; the last time he looked for a missing person the outcome left something to be desired. But Dino has a way of being persuasive, and Tru promises to give it a day or two.<br>When the first person he questions is murdered, and when he himself is shot at, Truman Smith is reminded of all the reasons he hates missing person cases. But he's committed now: Outside Harry's life is in his hands, and Smith is going to see to it that if Harry has any secrets he wants to tell, he won't have to take them to an early grave.</p><p>Bill Crider is the chairman of the English and Fine Arts Department at Alvin Community College.Galveston, Tex., shamus Truman Smith, the slowest-moving of Crider's three series detectives (Gator Kill, 1992, etc.), reluctantly agrees to search for Outside Harry Mercer, a destitute homeless man who turns out to be the most popular fellow on the island. His friend Dino, Truman's client, is looking for him, of course, but so are his homeless buddy Ro-Jo (who thinks Harry might be holed up in The Island Retreat, an abandoned gambling den once run by the uncles, Galveston's homegrown illegal city fathers); ruined millionaire Patrick Lytle (who tells Truman he wants to give Harry a home on his skeletal estate); and Alex Minor (who says he's a lawyer working for Harry's sister). About the only folks who don't seem to be looking for Harry are Truman's boss, bail bondsman Wally Zintner, and his big, nasty bounty hunter Dale Becker-- except, of course, that they are. Why the sudden flutter of interest in forgettable Harry? Truman sneaks enough time away from his current reading--Look Homeward Angel, a great book for guys who aren't in a hurry--to tie Harry, together with Braddy Macklin, the onetime uncles' bodyguard he finds dead in The Retreat, to a plan to bring gambling back to the island. Shambling and shapeless, with lots of shooting in darkened rooms in lieu of the kind of suspense that might be sparked by your wanting to know what happened to people you care about. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The thousands of letters he wrote retain their vitality to this day, discussing changes in morals, the writing of history, literature and philosophy, politics, war and peace, and the advent of modernism. <br><br>Strachey believed that one only really comes to know a writer by reading his correspondence, and if these playful, provocative, and eminently sensible letters attest to anything, it is to the soundness of this belief. <br><br></p><p><br><b>Lytton Strachey</b> (1880-1932) was a member of the Bloomsbury Group and the author of several classic biographies, including <i>Queen Victoria</i> and <i>Elizabeth and Essex</i>. His <i>Eminent Victorians</i>, published in 1918, inaugurated a new style of biography distinguished by irony, wit, and irreverence.<br><br>A complete edition of Lytton Strachey's letters would total six volumes, testament to the ferocious epistolary energy of the author of the classic <i>Eminent Victorians</i>, which ridiculed the hapless inhabitants of that era as priggish, canting hypocrites and revolutionized the biographical form. Levy, a Strachey trustee and editor of <i>Lytton Strachey: The Really Interesting Question</i>, has selected the best of them, no easy task given that letter writing was Strachey's natural mode of communication. As a pivotal member of the Bloomsbury group&#x2014;whose luminaries included Virginia Woolf and John Maynard Keynes&#x2014;Strachey's interests delved deep and spanned wide, encompassing theater, painting, history, literature, music, modernism, waspish gossip&#x2014;and sex, including some forms still considered shocking even in our jaded day. For the conflicted Strachey (1880&#x2013;1932)&#x2014;a radical member of the upper-class, a hypochondriac who died at 51 of an undiagnosed cancer, a sentimental cynic, a masochist who hurt others by telling them painful truths, a homosexual who had affairs with women&#x2014;the serious was trivial, the trivial, serious; and he never could decide whether, as he remarked to his brother James, "I'm an utter fool, a genius, or an ordinary person." As Levy's careful, sensitive volume demonstrates, he was all three&#x2014;and many more. <i>(Dec.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He built a temple at Jerusalem that was said to be more fabulous than any other landmark in the ancient world, heavily adorned with gold from Ophir. The precise location of this legendary land has been one of history&#39;s great unsolved mysteries. Long before Rider Haggard&#39;s classic adventure novel King Solomon&#39;s Mines produced a fresh outbreak of gold fever, explorers, scientists and theologians had scoured the world for the source of the king&#39;s astonishing wealth. Tahir Shah takes up the quest, using as his leads a mixture of texts including the Septuagint, the earliest form of the Bible, as well as geological, geographical and folkloric sources. Time and again the evidence points towards Ethiopia, the ancient kingdom in the horn of Africa whose imperial family claims descent from Menelik, the son born to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba. Tahir Shah&#39;s trail takes him to a remote cliff-face monastery where the monks pull visitors up on a leather rope, to the ruined castles of Gondar, and to the churches of Lalibela, hewn from solid rock.In the south, he discovers an enormous illegal gold mine where thousands of men, women and children dig with their hands. But the hardest leg of the journey is to the accursed mountain of Tullu Wallel, where legend says there lies an ancient shaft, once the entrance of King Solomon&#39;s mines.</p><p>Tahir Shah was born into a respected Afghan family and educated in England. He has lived in Japan, India and the United States and East Africa, and his books include &#39;Sorcerer&#39;s Apprentice&#39;, &#39;Trail of Feathers&#39; and &#39;Beyond the Devil&#39;s Teeth&#39;. He lives in London with his wife and young daughter.Travel writer Shah (Sorcerer's Apprentice; Trail of Feathers) paid 600 shekels in a Jerusalem souk for a dubious map of the route to King Solomon's mines; he admits, "I have an insatiable appetite for questionable souvenirs." The London-based writer is also fond of danger: "As soon as there's a bomb, an earthquake, a tidal wave or a riot, I call the travel agent and book cut-price seats." But the ultimate thrill is a challenging mission, and this time, it's finding the biblical land of Ophir, legendary source of the gold for King Solomon's Temple and perhaps of the Queen of Sheba's riches as well. History and geography point to Ethiopia. In Addis Ababa, Shah hires a vocally Christian taxi driver who becomes his guide, and the two set out on the quest. They wander rural Ethiopia, sleeping in brothels, slipping into illegal mines, walking through deserts in camel-led caravans and finally, riding mules to the alleged source of Solomon's gold. Along the way, Shah learns loads of useful things: prostitutes require customers to wash themselves with Coca Cola to avoid AIDS; the hyena-man of Harar feeds the hyenas nightly to keep them from carrying off the village children; gold miners fear disembowelment by thieves trying to extract the nuggets they've swallowed on the job. Does Shah get the gold in the end? Well... he's more Don Quixote than Indiana Jones. Shah is so entertaining, most readers won't realize that while walking on the wild side, they've also just done a quick course in Ethiopian history. 16 pages of b&amp;w photos, one map.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Be a Better Dad Today!: 10 Tools Every Father Needs</h2><p>The Honorable Gregory W.

The East will help us to conquer the West.'<br><br>Pieced together from secret reports and eye-witness memoirs, this is the first book to tell the story of the Bolshevik attempt to spread Marxism throughout Asia and its frustration by British Indian intelligence agents. An extraordinary story of the intrigue and treachery of the Great Game, its key<br>players include Chinese warlords, Muslim visionaries, and a White Russian baron who roasted his Communist captives alive.</p><p>Amid the sand and rock of Central Asia, Russia and England spent much of the 19th century playing what historians have come to call the Great Game: the struggle for control over transcontinental routes from Europe to the Far East. When the Bolsheviks came to power in 1917, Lenin continued to press Russian--now Soviet--claims to faraway, fabled places such as Samarkand and Hotan. The intrigues of his agents and their British counterparts, swashbucklers all, could come from a modern spy novel, and they make for fascinating reading in Peter Hopkirk&#39;s vivid account.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Eagle of the Ninth</h2><p><p>The Ninth Legion marched into the mists of Northern Britain&#x2015;and they were never seen again. Thousands of men disappeared and their eagle standard was lost. It's a mystery that's never been solved, until now . . .<br> Marcus has to find out what happened to his father, who led the legion. So he sets out into the unknown, on a quest so dangerous that nobody expects him to return.</p></p><p><p><b>Rosemary Sutcliff</b> (1920-1992) wrote dozens of books for young readers, including her award-winning Roman Britain trilogy, <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i>, <i>The Silver Branch</i>, and <i>The Lantern Bearers</i>, which won the Carnegie Medal. <i>The Eagle of the Ninth</i> is now a major motion picture, The Eagle, directed by Kevin MacDonald and starring Channing Tatum. Born in Surrey, Sutcliff spent her childhood in Malta and on various other naval bases where her father was stationed. At a young age, she contracted Still's Disease, which confined her to a wheelchair for most of her life. Shortly before her death, she was named Commander of the British Empire (CBE) one of Britain's most prestigious honors. She died in West Sussex, England, in 1992.</p>I&nbsp;Frontier Fort <p>From the Fosseway westward to Isca Dumnoniorum the road was simply a British trackway, broadened and roughly metalled, strengthened by corduroys of logs in the softest places, but otherwise unchanged from its old estate, as it wound among the hills, thrusting farther and farther into the wilderness.</p><p>It was a busy road and saw many travellers: traders with bronze weapons and raw yellow amber in their ponies&#x2019; packs; country folk driving shaggy cattle or lean pigs from village to village; sometimes a band of tawny-haired tribesmen from farther west; strolling harpers and quack-oculists too, or a light-stepping hunter with huge wolf-hounds at his heel; and from time to time a commissariat wagon going up and down to supply the Roman frontier post. The road saw them all, and the cohorts of the Eagles for whom all other travellers must make way.</p><p>There was a cohort of leather-clad auxiliaries on the road today, swinging along at the steady Legion&#x2019;s pace that had brought them down from Isca Silurium at twenty miles a day; the new garrison coming to relieve the old one at Isca Dumnoniorum. On they went, following the road that now ran out on a causeway between sodden marsh and empty sky, now plunged into deep boar-hunted forest, or lifted over bleak uplands where nothing grew save furze and thorn-scrub. On with never a halt nor a change of rhythm, marching Century by Century, the sun bright on the Standard at their head, and the rolling dust-cloud kicked up over the pack-train behind.</p><p>At the head of the column marched the Pilus Prior Centurion, the Cohort Commander, the pride that shone from him showing clearly that this was his first command. They were, he had long since decided, a command worthy of anyone&#x2019;s pride; six hundred yellow-haired giants recruited from the tribes of Upper Gaul, with the natural fighting power of mountain cats, drilled and hammered into what he firmly believed to be the finest Auxiliary Cohort ever to serve with the Second Legion. They were a newly joined Cohort; many of the men had not yet proved themselves in action, and the spear-shaft of their Standard had no honours on it, no gilded laurel wreath nor victor&#x2019;s crown. The honours were all to win&#x2014;perhaps during his command.</p><p>The Commander was a complete contrast to his men: Roman to his arrogant fingertips, wiry and dark as they were raw-boned and fair. The olive-skinned face under the curve of his crested helmet had not a soft line in it anywhere&#x2014;a harsh face it would have been, but that it was winged with laughter lines, and between his level black brows showed a small raised scar that marked him for one who had passed the Raven Degree of Mithras.</p><p>Centurion Marcus Flavius Aquila had seen little of the Eagles until a year ago. His first ten years had been lived quietly with his mother on the family farm near Clusium, while his father soldiered in Judaea, in Egypt, and here in Britain. They had been going to join his father in Britain, but before the time came for them to do so, rebellion had flared up among the northern tribes, and the Ninth Hispana, his father&#x2019;s Legion, had marched north to deal with it, and never came marching back.</p><p>His mother had died soon afterward, leaving him to be brought up in Rome by a rather foolish aunt and the plump and purse-proud official who was her husband. Marcus had loathed the official, and the official had loathed Marcus. They saw everything with different eyes. Marcus came of a line of soldiers&#x2014;one of those Equestrian families who, when the rest of their kind had turned from soldiering to trade and finance, had kept to the old way of life, and remained poor but held their noses high in consequence. The official came of a line of officials, and his code of life was quite other than Marcus&#x2019;s. Neither of them had a shred of understanding for each other&#x2019;s ideas, and they had both been thankful when Marcus was eighteen and could apply for a centurion&#x2019;s commission.</p><p>Marcus, his eyes narrowed into the sun as he marched, smiled to himself a little wryly, as he remembered how almost pathetically thankful that plump official had been. (Tramp, tramp, tramp, said the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>He had asked to be sent to Britain, though it meant starting in an auxiliary cohort instead of a line-of-battle one, partly because his father&#x2019;s elder brother had settled there when his own years of soldiering were done, but mostly because of his father. If ever anything became known of the lost Legion, it would be known first in Britain, and it might even be that here in Britain he would find out something for himself.</p><p>Marching down the Isca Dumnoniorum road in the run-honey evening light, he found himself thinking about his father. He had very vivid memories of a slight, dark man with laughter lines at the corners of his eyes, who had come home from time to time, and taught him to fish, to play &#x201c;Flash the Fingers,&#x201d; and throw a javelin. He remembered vividly that last leave of all. His father had just been appointed to command the First Cohort of the Hispana, which meant having charge of the Eagle and being something very like second-in-command of the Legion besides; and he had been like a jubilant boy about it. But his mother had been faintly anxious, almost as if she knew...</p><p>&#x201c;If it was any other Legion!&#x201d; she had said. &#x201c;You have told me yourself that the Hispana has a bad name.&#x201d;</p><p>And his father had replied: &#x201c;But I would not have it any other Legion if I could. I held my first command in the Hispana, and a man&#x2019;s first Legion is apt to hold chief place in his heart ever after, be its name good or bad; and now that I go back to it as First Cohort, we will see whether there is nothing can be done to better its name.&#x201d; He had turned to his small son, laughing. &#x201c;Presently it will be your turn. It has fallen on evil days, but we will make a Legion of the Hispana yet, you and I.&#x201d;</p><p>Looking back across the years, Marcus remembered that his father&#x2019;s eyes had been very bright, like the eyes of a man going into action; and the light had caught suddenly in the great flawed emerald of the signet-ring he always wore, striking from it a spark of clear green fire. Odd how one remembered things like that: little things that somehow mattered.</p><p>(Tramp, tramp, tramp, came the sound of the cohort&#x2019;s feet behind him.)</p><p>It would be pleasant, he thought, if Uncle Aquila was like his father. He had not met his uncle yet; after learning his foot-drill he had arrived in Britain in the sleety days of late autumn, and been sent straight up to Isca; but he had a rather vague invitation to spend his leave with him at Calleva, when he had any leave to spend. It would be very pleasant if Uncle Aquila was like his father.</p><p>Not of course that he and his uncle were likely to have much to do with each other. In a few years&#x2019; time he would probably be serving in quite a different part of the Empire, since a Cohort Centurion seldom moved up all the way in the same Legion.</p><p>All the way...from his present rank right up to his father&#x2019;s rank of First Cohort; and after that? For most of the men who got so far there was nothing after that, but for the outstanding few who went further&#x2014;as Marcus intended to go further&#x2014;the ways divided there. One could become a Camp Commandant, as Uncle Aquila had done, or one could go on, by way of the Praetorian Guard, to try for command of a Legion. Legion Commanders were almost always men of Senator&#x2019;s rank, with no experience of soldiering save a year&#x2019;s service as Military Tribune in their youth; but by long custom the two Egyptian Legions were exceptions to the rule. They were commanded by professional soldiers; and an Egyptian Legion had been Marcus&#x2019;s shining goal for as long as he could remember.</p><p>But one day, when he had finished with the Eagles, when he had made an honourable name and become Prefect of his Egyptian Legion, he would go home to the Etruscan hills, and perhaps even buy back the old farm, which the plump official had ruthlessly sold to defray expenses. For a moment he remembered almost painfully the sunlit courtyard flickered over with the shadow of pigeons&#x2019; wings, and the wild olive tree in the loop of the stream, on a twisted root of which he had once found a kind of gall growing, that was shaped something like a little bird. He had cut it from the root with the new knife his father had given him, and spent much loving care, all one absorbed summer evening, trimming and carving feathers on it. He had that little bird still.</p><p>The road topped a gentle rise, and suddenly Isca Dumnoniorum lay before them, with the fortress-crowned Red Mount dark with shadows against the evening sky; and Marcus came back to the present with a jerk. The farm in the Etruscan hills could wait until he was old and tired and famous; in the present was the glory of his first command.</p><p>The British town was spread below the southern scarp of the Mount; a sprawling huddle of reed-thatched roofs, every colour from the gold of honey to the black of dried peat, according to the age of the thatch; with the squared, clean lines of the Roman forum and basilica looking oddly rootless in their midst; and the faint haze of woodsmoke lying over all.</p><p>The road led straight through the town and up to the cleared slope beyond, to the Praetorian gate of the fort; here and there, crimson-or saffron-cloaked men turned to look at the cohort as it swung by, a look that was reserved rather than hostile. Dogs sat scratching in odd corners, lean pigs rooted among the garbage piles, and women with bracelets of gold or copper on very white arms sat in hut doorways, spinning, or grinding corn. The blue smoke of many cooking-fires curled up into the quiet air, and the savoury smell of many evening meals mingled with the blue reek of woodsmoke and the sharper tang of horse-droppings, which Marcus had by now come to associate with all British towns. Little that was Roman was here as yet, despite the stone-built forum. One day there would be straight streets, he supposed, and temples and bathhouses and a Roman way of life. But as yet it was a place where two worlds met without mingling: a British town huddled under the dominion of the turf ramparts where once the tribe had had its stronghold and now the Roman sentries paced up and down. He looked about him under the curve of his helmet as he marched, knowing that this place would be part of his life for the next year; then looked up to the turf ramparts, and saw a Roman banner drooping in the still air and the tall crest of a sentry burning in the sunset, and heard a trumpet-call ring out, as it seemed, from the fiery sky.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You have brought clear skies with you,&#x201d; said Centurion Quintus Hilarion, lounging in the window of the Commander&#x2019;s quarters, and peering into the night. &#x201c;But Hercle! you need not expect it to last.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As bad as that?&#x201d; said Centurion Marcus Aquila, who was seated on the table.</p><p>&#x201c;Quite as bad as that! It rains always, here in the west, save when Typhon, the father of all ills, brews up a mist to come between a man and his own feet. By the time you have served your year here you will have toadstools sprouting out of your ears, the same as me, and not from the damp alone!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From what besides?&#x201d; enquired Marcus with interest. &#x201c;Oh, lack of company, for one thing. I am a sociable soul myself; I like my friends around me.&#x201d; He turned from the window, and folded up on to a low cushioned bench, hugging his knees. &#x201c;Ah well, I am off to rub away the blue mould as soon as I have marched the troops back to Isca.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Going on leave?&#x201d;</p><p>The other nodded. &#x201c;Long leave, lovely leave, among the flesh-pots of Durinum.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Durinum&#x2014;that is your home?&#x201d; asked Marcus. &#x201c;Yes. My father retired and settled there a few years ago. There is a surprisingly good circus, and plenty of people&#x2014;pretty girls too. A pleasant enough place to get back to, out of the wilds.&#x201d; An idea seemed to strike him. &#x201c;What shall you do when your leave falls due? I suppose, coming out from home, you have no one here to go to?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have an uncle at Calleva, though I have not yet met him,&#x201d; Marcus said, &#x201c;and certainly there is no one at home I should want to spend my leave with.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Father and mother both dead?&#x201d; enquired Hilarion with friendly interest.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. My father went with the Ninth Legion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pericol! You mean when they&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Disappeared. Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So. That is bad!&#x201d; said Hilarion, wagging his head. &#x201c;A deal of ugly stories, there were&#x2014;still are, for that matter; and of course, they did lose the Eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>Instantly Marcus was up in arms to defend his father and his father&#x2019;s Legion. &#x201c;Since not a man of the Legion came back, it is scarcely a matter for wonder that neither did the Eagle,&#x201d; he flashed.</p><p>&#x201c;Surely not,&#x201d; agreed Hilarion amicably. &#x201c;I was not blowing on your father&#x2019;s honour, so you can keep your feathers on, my Marcus.&#x201d; He looked up at the other with a wide, friendly grin, and suddenly Marcus, who had been ready to quarrel with him the instant before, found himself grinning back.</p><p>It was several hours since Marcus had marched his Cohort across the hollow-ringing bridge, answering the sentry&#x2019;s challenge, &#x201c;Fourth Gaulish Auxiliaries of the Second Legion, come to relieve this garrison.&#x201d; Dinner was over, in the officers&#x2019; mess, with the Quartermaster, the Surgeon, and the double complement of ranker Centurions. Marcus had taken charge of the pay-chest keys&#x2014;in a garrison as small as this there was no paymaster; and for the past hour, here in the Commander&#x2019;s quarters in the Praetorium, he and Hilarion had been going through the office work of the frontier fort. Now, crested helmets and embossed breastplates laid aside, the two of them were taking their ease.</p><p>Through the doorless opening Marcus could see almost the whole of the sleeping-cell, the narrow cot piled with gay native rugs, the polished oaken chest, the lamp-bracket high on the bare wall, and nothing more. The outer room held the battered writing table on which Marcus was sitting, a cross-legged camp-stool, the cushioned bench to represent comfort, another chest for the record rolls, and a bronze pedestal lamp of peculiarly hideous design.</p><p>In the little silence that had fallen between them, Marcus looked round him at the austere room in the yellow flood of lamplight, and to him it seemed beautiful. But though it would be his tomorrow, for this one night he was a guest here, and he looked back to his host with a quick smile of apology for having looked too soon at his surroundings with the eye of mastery.</p><p>Hilarion grinned. &#x201c;You will not be feeling like that this day next year.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder,&#x201d; said Marcus, swinging one sandalled foot and idly watching the swing of it. &#x201c;What does one do here, besides growing toadstools? Is there good hunting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good enough; it is the one thing to be said for this particular corner of the Empire. Boar and wolf in the winter, and the forest swarms with deer. There are several hunters below in the town, who will take you out for the price of the day&#x2019;s work. Unwise to go alone, of course.&#x201d;</p><p>Marcus nodded. &#x201c;Have you any advice for me? I am new to this country.&#x201d;</p><p>The other considered. &#x201c;No, I think not.&#x201d; Then he sat up with a jerk. &#x201c;Yes, I have, if no one has warned you already. But it has nothing to do with the hunting. It is the priest-kind&#x2014;the wandering Druids. If one of them appears in the district, or you get the least idea that there is one about, look to your weapons. Good advice, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Druids?&#x201d; Marcus was surprised and puzzled. &#x201c;But surely Suetonius Paulinus dealt with them once and for all, sixty years ago?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As an organized priesthood, maybe; but as easily hold off these heathen mists with a palm-leaf umbrella as end the Druids by destroying their strong...</p></p><h2>Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory</h2><p>In this second edition of <i>Beginning Theory</i>, the variety of approaches, theorists, and technical language is lucidly and expertly unraveled and explained, and allows readers to develop their own ideas once first principles have been grasped.

He took notes and concealed them from the Japanese for nearly three years, but lost them when he was forced to bury them to avoid repeated searches. Coast had to write the book all over again while on the voyage home. His book is moving, dramatic, and chilling in the detail it gives of the cruelty inflicted by Japanese and Korean soldiers on the prisoners and Asian workers who died in even greater numbers working on the railway. Yet it is at the same time lyrical in its descriptions of the natural world surrounding the camps and the food and kindness shown by some Thais to the prisoners. Coast brings to life the camps and towns of the Burma Railway and the culture of Bali and Indonesia that&nbsp;allowed him to find some comfort and meaning amid the horror. This new edition has an introduction and appendices which&nbsp;include&nbsp;transcriptions of his BBC interviews with his Japanese captors and Takashi Nagase. Other appendices include never before published documents which help reveal details about secret radios and attempted escapes masterminded by the talented group of officers around Coast.&nbsp;It also&nbsp;includes an index and list of newly identified individuals mentioned in the book.</p></p><p><b>John Coast</b> (1916-1989)&nbsp;was&nbsp;a prisoner of war that was sent into Thailand to build railways for the Japanese and the story of that time, <i>Railroad of Death</i>, became a bestseller and was later to form the subject of Return to the River Kwai, a documentary made in 1969 for the BBC.

Cecilia, capricious and unable to really love anyone, moves reluctantly towards a second marriage to the kind, passionless Julian Tower. Emmeline, gentle but independent, is surprised to find the calm tenor of her life disturbed by her attraction to the predatory Mark Linkwater. At first she is able to accept their love-affair on Mark&#39;s terms but, in the pain of misunderstanding, Emmeline reveals her vulnerability in a violent and tragic act. Through delicate counterpoint, Elizabeth Bowen reveals her insight into the obscure motives that dictate human behaviour and explores the emotional chasm between men and women.Elizabeth Bowen was born in Dublin in 1899, the only child of an Irish lawyer and land-owner. She travelled a great deal, dividing most of her time between London and Bowen&#39;s Court, the family house in County Cork which she inherited. Her first book, a collection of shorts stories, Encounters, was published in 1923. The Hotel (1926) was her first novel. She was awarded the CBE in 1948, and received honorary degrees from Trinity College, Dublin in 1949, and from Oxford University in 1956. The Royal Society of Literature made her a Companion of Literature in 1965. Elizabeth Bowen died in 1973.</p><h2>Opening Arguments: A Young Lawyer&#39;s First Case : United States Vs. Oliver L. North</h2><p>In January of 1987 Jeffrey Toobin is fresh out of Harvard Law School, and appointed the youngest lawyer on Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh&#39;s team to investigate and try the leading figure in the Iran-Contra affair--Oliver North. For twenty-eight thrilling months, Toobin served on Walsh&#39;s staff and came of age into his profession. Toobin&#39;s first book and immersive account of that period is the story of a young man&#39;s awakening to the realities of law and a policial, legal and moral drama on a grand stage. Through this defining case of the 1980s--which featured obstruction of justice, diversion of funds, and personal corruption--Opening Arguments shows the judicial process at work. The Congressional Iran-Contra committees granted the key figures of the trial immunity, so Toobin and his colleagues had to work in the dark, without accesss to newspapers or television for weeks at a time. The Reagan Justice Department provided difficulties too.

They always will. It&#x2019;s only our stories about them that ever change.<br><br>In the sixth century b.c. the Greek lawmaker Solon journeyed to the Egyptian city of Sais and brought back the following account of the end of the world. According to the priests at the temple of Neith, a cataclysm will sweep the Earth with flames and poisonous smoke. In a single day and night an entire continent will founder and sink into the sea, and a false messiah will lead all of humanity to its doom.<br><br>The Egyptian seers predicted that the Apocalypse will begin on a quiet night, on a lofty hilltop perched high above the kingdom of Los Angeles. There, the ancient oracles sing, a lock will snap open. Among the great walled houses of Beverly Crest, a stout bolt will slide aside. As recorded by Solon, a hinged pair of security gates will swing wide apart. Below these, the realms of Westwood and Brentwood and Santa Monica await, sleeping, laid out in a spider&#x2019;s web of streetlights. And as the last clock tick of midnight echoes away, within those wide-open gates will dwell only darkness and silence until an engine can be heard rumbling to life, and two lights will seem to lead that noise forward. And from out of that gateway will issue a Lincoln Town Car which slouches forth to begin its slow descent down the hairpin curves of upper Hollywood Boulevard.<br><br>That night, as depicted in ancient prophecy, is tranquil, without a breath of wind; nevertheless, with the Lincoln&#x2019;s slow progress a tempest begins to mount in its wake.<br><br>As it descends from Beverly Crest to the Hollywood Hills, the Lincoln stretches as long and black as the tongue of someone strangled by a noose. With pink smears of streetlights sliding down the burnished black shell of it, the Town Car shines like a scarab escaping a tomb. And at North Kings Road the lights of Beverly Hills and Hancock Park blink and go dark, not house by house but blocks and blocks of the grid are blotted out in their entirety. And at North Crescent Heights Boulevard, the neighborhood of Laurel Canyon is obliterated; not merely the lights but the noise and late-night music are vanquished. Any shimmering proof of the city is erased as the car flows downhill, from North Fairfax to Ogden Drive to North Gardner Street. And thus does darkness wash over the city, following in the shadow of the sleek car.<br><br>And so, too, does a brutal wind follow. As foretold by the priests of ages past, this gale makes thrashing mops of the towering palm trees along Hollywood Boulevard, and these sweep the sky. Their clashing fronds cast down horrible, soft shapes that land with screams against the pavement. With beady caviar eyes and scaly serpent tails, these fierce, soft shapes hammer the passing Town Car. They drop squealing. Their frenzied claws scratch at the air. Their slamming impacts do not break the windshield, because the glass is bulletproof. And the rolling tires of the Lincoln rumble over them, pulping their fallen flesh. And these plummeting, shrieking, clutching shapes are rats. Cast to their deaths, these are the flailing bodies of opossums. The tires of the Lincoln burst this red carpet of crushed fur. The windshield wipers clear the driver&#x2019;s view of the still-warm blood, and the crushed bones do not puncture the tires, because the rubber, too, is bulletproof.<br><br>And so relentless is the wind that it rakes the street, pushing along this burden of crippled vermin, trundling this tide of suffering always in the wake of the Town Car as it reaches Spaulding Square. Fissures of lightning fracture the sky, and rain is pushed into great curtains that strafe the tiled roofs. Thunder blasts a fanfare as the rain plunders the city&#x2019;s garbage cans, loosing plastic bags and Styrofoam cups.<br><br>And hard by the looming tower of the Roosevelt Hotel the boulevard is otherwise deserted and the army of trash advances on the city unimpeded by traffic lights or other automobiles. Every street, every intersection is deserted. The sidewalks are empty, as the ancient soothsayers have promised, and every window is dark.<br><br>The boiling sky is without the roving lights of aircraft, and the choked storm drains leave the streets awash in rain and fur. These streets slippery with offal. And by Grauman&#x2019;s Chinese Theatre is all of Los Angeles reduced to such butchery and chaos.<br><br>Yet not far ahead of the car, in the 6700 block&#x2014;there the neon lights still shine. In that single block of Hollywood Boulevard the night is warm and still. No rain wets the pavement, and the green awnings of Musso and Frank Grill hang motionless. The clouds above that city block are open like a tunnel to reveal the moon, and the trees along the sidewalks are motionless. So coated in red are the headlights of the Lincoln that they cast a scarlet path for the car to follow. These glaring red beams reveal a young maiden on the sidewalk, and she stands across the street from the Hollywood Wax Museum. And there in the eye of this awful storm she gazes down on a star shape cast in pink concrete, sunk flush in the sidewalk. In her earlobes she wears dime-size, dazzle-cut cubic zirconia. And her feet are shod in counterfeit Manolo Blahniks. The soft folds of her straight-line skirt and cashmere sweater are dry. Masses of curled, red hair cascade about her shoulders.<br><br>The name cast in the pink star is &#x201c;Camille Spencer,&#x201d; but this maiden is not Camille Spencer.<br><br>A pink gob of dried chewing gum, several gobs, pink and gray and green, deface the sidewalk like scabs. Printed with the marks of human teeth, the gum is also printed with the zigzag tread of passing feet. The young maiden pries at these with the pointed toe of her faux-Manolo until she can kick the scabrous gum away. Until the star is, if not clean, cleaner.<br><br>In this bubble of still, placid night the maiden grips the hem of her skirt and brings it close to her mouth. She spits on the fabric and kneels to polish the star, buffing bright the name cast there in brass, embedded in the pink concrete. When the Town Car pulls to the curb beside her, the girl stands and steps around the star with the same respect with which one would step around a grave. In one hand she carries a pillowcase. Her fingers, their chipped white nails clenched in a fist, hold this sack of white cloth sagging heavy with Tootsie Rolls, Charleston Chews, and licorice whips. In her opposite hand she holds a half-eaten Baby Ruth.<br><br>Her porcelain-veneered teeth chew idly. A margin of melted chocolate outlines her pouting, bee-stung lips. The prophets of Sais warn that the beauty of this young woman is such that anyone seeing her will forget any pleasure beyond eating and sex. So physically appealing is her earthly form that her viewer is reduced to nothing more than stomach and skin. And the oracles sing that neither is she alive nor dead. Neither mortal nor spirit.<br><br>And parked, idling at the curb, the Lincoln is dripping red. The curbside rear window hums down a crack, and a voice announces itself from the plush interior. In the eye of that hurricane, a male voice asks, &#x201c;Trick or treat?&#x201d;<br><br>A stone&#x2019;s throw in any direction, the night remains churning behind an invisible wall.<br><br>The maiden&#x2019;s lips, glossed with a red-red lipstick&#x2014;a color called &#x201c;Man Hunt&#x201d;&#x2014;her full lips curl into a smile. Here, the air hangs so calm that one can detect the scent of her perfume, like flowers left in a tomb, pressed flat and dried for a thousand years. She leans close to the open window and says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too late. It&#x2019;s already tomorrow. . . .&#x201d; She pauses for a long, lustful wink blanketed in turquoise eye shadow, and asks, &#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d;<br><br>And it&#x2019;s obvious the man is drinking champagne, because in that quiet moment even the bubbles of his champagne sound loud. And the ticking of the man&#x2019;s wristwatch sounds loud. And his voice within the car says, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time for all bad girls to go to bed.&#x201d;<br><br>Wistful now, the young woman sighs. She licks her lips, and her smile falters. Half-coy, half-resigned, she says, &#x201c;I guess I violated my curfew.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Being violated,&#x201d; says the man, &#x201c;can feel wonderful.&#x201d; In turn, the Lincoln&#x2019;s rear door swings open to admit her, and without hesitation the maiden steps inside. And that door constitutes a gate, the prophets sing. And that car is, itself, a mouth gobbling candy. And the Town Car shuts her within its stomach: an interior as thickly upholstered with velvet as a casket. The tinted window hums closed. The car idles, its hood steaming, its polished body streaming, edged now with a red fringe, a growing beard of coagulated blood. Crimson tire tracks lead up whence it came to where it now sits parked. Behind it, the storm lashes, but here the only sounds are the muffled ejaculations of a man crying out. The ancients describe the sound as a mewing, like rats and mice being crushed to death.<br><br>Silence follows, and after that the rear window once more slides open. The chipped white fingernails reach out. Dangling from them is a latex skin, a smaller version of the girl&#x2019;s white pillowcase, a miniature sack hanging heavy. Its contents: something murky white. This latex sheath is smeared with the red-red lipstick. It&#x2019;s smeared with caramel and milk chocolate. Instead of dropping this into the gutter, still seated in the car&#x2019;s backseat, the girl brings her face to the open window. She places the latex sack against her lips and breathes it full of air. She inflates it and deftly knots the open end. The way a midwife would secure the umbilical cord of an infant. The way a carnival clown would knot a balloon. She ties the inflated skin, sealing the milky contents within, and her fingers twist it. She bends and twists the tube of it until the shape becomes that of a human being with two arms, two legs, a head. A voodoo doll. It&#x2019;s the size of a newborn babe. This foul creation, still candy-coated from her lips, murky with the man&#x2019;s mysterious soupy contents, she flings into the center of the waiting pink star.<br><br>According to the prophecies writ down by Solon, that small effigy is a sacrifice of blood and seed and sugar, laid there on that sacred pentagram shape, an offering made beside Hollywood Boulevard.<br><br>On that night, with that ritual begins the countdown to Doomsday.<br><br>And once again the automobile&#x2019;s mirrored window fills its frame. And at this instant, the storm, the rain and darkness, these swallow the car. As the Lincoln departs the curb, bearing the young maiden away, the winds herd her castoff thing-baby. That knotted bladder. That graven image. The wind and rains shepherd their bountiful harvest of slaughtered vermin and plastic trash and dried chewing gum, tumbling and driving it all in the direction of gravity.<br><br>december 21, 6:03 a.m. cet<br>I Eat; Therefore I Am<br>Posted by Madisonspencer@aftrlife.hell<br><br> Gentle Tweeter,<br><br>It&#x2019;s worth noting up front that I have always conceived of my mind as a digestive organ.

He was taken to Rome for his education with the idea of a public career and by the year 70 he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome. In the meantime his political career was well under way and he was elected praetor for the year 66. One of the most permanent features of his political life was his attachment to Pompeii. As a politician, his greatest failing was his consistent refusal to compromise; as a statesman his ideals were more honorable and unselfish than those of his contemporaries. Cicero was the greatest of the roman orators, posessing a wide range of technique and an excpetional command of the Latin tongue. He followed the common practice of publishing his speeches, but he also produced a large number of works on the theory and practice of rhetoric, on religion, and on moral and political philosophy. He played a leading part in the development of the Latin hexameter. Perhaps the most interesting of all his works is the collection fo 900 remarkably informative letters, published posthumously.

Your father will be here any minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no answer. Not that Val was surprised. Her daughter rarely answered until at least her third try.<br> <br>&#x201c;Brianne,&#x201d; she dutifully obliged, &#x201c;how are you coming along with the packing?&#x201d;<br> <br>The sound of a door opening, agitated footsteps in the upstairs hallway, a blur of shoulder-length brown hair and long, lean legs, the shock of a lacy black thong and matching push-up bra alternating with layers of bare skin, the sight of a pair of balled fists resting with familiar impatience on slender hips. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be coming along fine if you&#x2019;d stop interrupting me.&#x201d; Brianne&#x2019;s voice tumbled down the green-carpeted steps, almost knocking Valerie over with the force of their casual disdain.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not even dressed,&#x201d; Valerie sputtered. &#x201c;Your father . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . will be late,&#x201d; her daughter said with the kind of rude certainty that only sixteen-year-old girls seemed to possess. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s always late.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long drive,&#x201d; Valerie argued. &#x201c;He said he wanted to get there before dinner.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Brianne had already disappeared from the top of the stairs. Seconds later, Valerie heard her daughter&#x2019;s bedroom door slam shut. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not even dressed,&#x201d; she whispered to the eggshell-colored walls. Which meant she probably hadn&#x2019;t started packing, either. &#x201c;Great. That&#x2019;s great.&#x201d; Which meant she&#x2019;d have to entertain her soon-to-be ex-husband and his new fianc�e until their daughter was ready. Which just might work to her advantage, she thought, since lately Evan had been hinting that things weren&#x2019;t going all that well with darling Jennifer, and that he might have made the biggest mistake of his life in letting Valerie go.<br> <br>It wouldn&#x2019;t be the first time he&#x2019;d made that particular mistake, Val thought, walking to the front door of her modern glass and brick Park Slope home and opening it, looking up and down the fashionable Brooklyn street for signs of Evan&#x2019;s approaching car. He&#x2019;d left her once before, running off with one of her bridesmaids just days before their wedding. Six weeks later he was back, full of abject apologies, and begging her to give him another chance. The girl meant nothing to him, he&#x2019;d sworn up and down. It was just a case of raw nerves and cold feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never be that stupid again,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said.<br> <br>Except, of course, he was.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re all the woman I&#x2019;ll ever need,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told her.<br> <br>Except, of course, she wasn&#x2019;t.<br> <br>In their eighteen years together, Val suspected at least a dozen affairs. She&#x2019;d turned a blind eye to all of them, somehow managing to convince herself that he was telling the truth whenever he called to say he&#x2019;d be working late, or that an urgent meeting had forced him to cancel their scheduled lunch. She&#x2019;d even insisted it was no big deal to concerned friends when they told her they&#x2019;d seen Evan at a popular Manhattan restaurant, nuzzling the neck of a young brunette. You know Evan, she&#x2019;d say with a confident laugh. He&#x2019;s just a big flirt. It doesn&#x2019;t mean anything.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d said it so many times, she&#x2019;d almost come to believe it.<br> <br>Almost.<br> <br>And then she&#x2019;d come home one afternoon, tired and depressed after a day of dealing with her mother, who stubbornly continued to resist dealing with her drinking problem, to find Evan in bed with the young woman he&#x2019;d recently hired to design a new ad campaign for his string of trendy boutique hotels, the girl&#x2019;s toned and shapely legs lifted high into the air above his broad shoulders, both of them totally oblivious to everything but their own impressive gymnastics, and her blind eye was forced wide open once and for all.<br> <br>Even then, it had been his choice to leave.<br> <br>I should hate him, Val thought.<br> <br>And yet, the awful, unforgivable truth was that she didn&#x2019;t hate him. The awful, even more unforgivable truth was that she still loved him, that she was still praying he&#x2019;d come to his senses, as he had after running off only days before their wedding, and come back to her.<br> <br><i>What&#x2019;s wrong with me?</i><br> <br>It&#x2019;s my own damn fault, she&#x2019;d chastised herself now. I knew what he was like when I married him. I knew from the first minute I laid eyes on him in the lobby of that small chalet in Switzerland, tanned and fit and holding court in front of a roaring fire, surrounded by adoring ski bunnies, that he was trouble. Exactly the kind of man she&#x2019;d spent her entire twenty-one years up to that point trying to avoid, a man of grand gestures and small cruelties, as charming as he was unsubtle. She knew the type well, having been raised by just such a man.<br> <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t mean anything,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her friends, the same words her mother had said to her.<br> <br>Well, maybe it didn&#x2019;t mean anything to men like her father, men like Evan, Val understood, but it meant the world to the women who loved them.<br> <br>And, ultimately, where did all that fortitude and forbearance leave them?<br> <br>It left them nowhere.<br> <br>They got dumped anyway.<br> <br>Her friends had breathed a collective sigh of relief at Evan&#x2019;s departure. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a moron,&#x201d; her closest friend, Melissa, had pronounced. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t deserve you,&#x201d; their mutual friend, James, had agreed. &#x201c;Believe me, you&#x2019;re better off.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her mother had been too drunk to say anything.<br> <br>Val could still picture the stricken look on her mother&#x2019;s face after her father had announced he was leaving her for one of his much younger conquests. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t mean anything. He&#x2019;ll be back,&#x201d; her mother had assured Valerie and her younger sister, Allison. But he never did come back, eventually marrying again and fathering two more children, both girls, daughters to replace the ones he&#x2019;d so easily abandoned. Meanwhile Val&#x2019;s mother had gradually morphed from a bright, engaging woman into a joyless and bitter old crone whose main source of comfort was a bottle. Is that what Val wanted for Brianne?<br> <br>&#x201c;Brianne, do you need some help?&#x201d; Val called out now, shutting the front door on the oppressive July heat and returning to the foot of the stairs.<br> <br>Evan was giving her pretty much everything she asked for in the divorce&#x2014;the house, the white Lexus SUV, substantial alimony, more than generous child support. Within days of moving out of their large home in Brooklyn, he&#x2019;d settled into Jennifer&#x2019;s small condo in Manhattan, seemingly none the worse for wear.<br> <br>I should hate him, Val thought again.<br> <br>Except that you don&#x2019;t stop loving someone you&#x2019;ve loved almost half your life just because they treat you badly, she&#x2019;d discovered, regardless of whether or not you should. Still, it wasn&#x2019;t fair that a woman celebrating her fortieth birthday would be pining over a man who&#x2019;d openly betrayed her, as if she were a lovesick teenager crying for the one who got away.<br> <br>Although he wasn&#x2019;t just any man. He was her husband of almost two decades, her husband for another month at least, until their divorce was final, despite the fact he was already engaged to somebody else. He was the love of her life, a man she&#x2019;d traversed the globe with repeatedly, helicopter skiing with him in the Swiss Alps, white-water rafting with him in Colorado, trekking with him to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro. &#x201c;The only woman who can keep up with me,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said . . . how many times?<br> <br>&#x201c;The only woman I&#x2019;ve ever really loved.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had been while they were hiking in the Adirondacks that she had suddenly dropped to her knees and surprised them both by proposing. &#x201c;What the hell,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d proclaimed with a laugh. &#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be an adventure.&#x201d;<br> <br>An adventure it had certainly been, Val thought now, trying&#x2014;and failing&#x2014;not to succumb to nostalgia. Those first few years before Brianne was born had been such a heady rush that it had been relatively easy to overlook Evan&#x2019;s wandering eye, to tell herself that she was imagining things, and when that proved impossible, to hold herself at least partly responsible for his actions, to urge herself to try harder, be more desirable, more available, more . . . all the things she obviously wasn&#x2019;t, all the while reminding herself that nothing mattered except that she was the one he really loved, and that no matter how far or how often he strayed, he would always come back to her.<br> <br>Evan wasn&#x2019;t her father.<br> <br>She wasn&#x2019;t her mother.<br> <br>Yet Val had been devastated to realize that she&#x2019;d fallen into the same trap as her mother after all, which made her all the more determined to react differently, to not give up, and to fight for her man with every ounce of her being. She hadn&#x2019;t even allowed her pregnancy to slow her down, indulging Evan&#x2019;s combined love of travel and danger by continuing to chase him down the steepest slopes and up the highest peaks. She&#x2019;d missed her daughter&#x2019;s first birthday so that she could accompany him to the Himalayas, justifying the trip by rationalizing that her husband came first, that a year-old child couldn&#x2019;t differentiate one day from the next, and that they&#x2019;d celebrate Brianne&#x2019;s birthday when they got home. She even wrote an article about their trip that was subsequently published in the travel section of the <i>New York Times</i>.<br> <br>It was the beginning of an unexpected, and unexpectedly successful, career, a career that came to an abrupt and equally unexpected halt the day Val returned home early from a trying day of dealing with her mother to find Evan in bed dealing with the comely Jennifer.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s my fault, Val told herself at the time. I got careless, complacent. As the years had progressed and Brianne had grown from infant to toddler to little girl who needed her mother, Val had become more and more loath to leave her. The threat of danger no longer held the same appeal it once had. She was a mother now. She had responsibilities. She even had a career. It wasn&#x2019;t just about her anymore.<br> <br>Except it had never really been about her. It had been about Evan.<br> <br>Always about Evan. Even now.<br> <br>How did that happen?<br> <br>Val wasn&#x2019;t some stupid little girl. She wasn&#x2019;t a complainer or a crybaby. She was very much in control of every aspect of her life, except one&#x2014;Evan. And maybe her mother. Okay, so, two aspects of her life. Make that three, she decided now, thinking of Brianne. &#x201c;Brianne,&#x201d; she shouted up the stairs in a renewed effort to silence the voices in her head, &#x201c;get a move on.&#x201d;<br> <br>The phone rang.<br> <br>Hopefully my mother calling to wish me a happy birthday, Valerie thought, cutting across the front foyer to the stainless-steel kitchen at the back of the house. Was it possible she&#x2019;d actually remembered? Val shook her head. More likely, she was calling to ask whether Val could drop off a few bottles of Merlot on her way into Manhattan.<br> <br>The sun had temporarily managed to break through the heavy rain clouds that had been hovering over the area for the better part of the week and was shining through the two-story-high window that took up the kitchen&#x2019;s entire west wall. Val hoped the rain had finally ended. The Adirondacks were undeniably beautiful, but camping wasn&#x2019;t a whole lot of fun in the rain, and unlike Val, Brianne was a reluctant camper at best.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do I have to go on this stupid camping trip anyway?&#x201d; she&#x2019;d been whining for weeks. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d much rather go into the city with you and your friends, go shopping, see some shows . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like that, too, sweetheart,&#x201d; Val had said truthfully. It was so rare that Brianne expressed an interest in doing anything with her these days. She was at the age where she considered her mother a necessary nuisance at best, an outright pain in the butt at worst, and it seemed they hardly spent any time together anymore. What time they <i>did</i> spend together was filled with pointless arguments that went nowhere and exhausting confrontations that left Val despairing over who this strange and willful creature was and what she&#x2019;d done with her daughter. Brianne was growing up and away from her so fast that it would have been nice having her along this weekend to celebrate her birthday. They could have used the time to get reacquainted.<br> <br>&#x201c;I still don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; Brianne was complaining again now, &#x201c;why I have to go on this dumb trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because your father wants you to go camping with him and . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . the slut?&#x201d; Brianne asked with a smile, watching for her mother&#x2019;s reaction. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t look so shocked. That&#x2019;s what <i>you</i> call her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Val made a silent promise to stop referring to Jennifer in this way. At least when her daughter was within earshot. &#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; she said now, picking up the phone, on the alert for the telltale slur in her mother&#x2019;s response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, you,&#x201d; Evan said instead, the same way he&#x2019;d been greeting her voice on the phone for almost two decades. Casual, yet intimate. Intimate, yet casual.<br> <br>Their marriage, in a nutshell.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; Val echoed, afraid to say more. She pictured her soon-to-be ex-husband sitting behind the wheel of his new black Jaguar, his soft, dark hair falling into his light blue eyes, his full lips curled into an easy smile, one hand on the wheel, the other hand sliding under Jennifer&#x2019;s skirt. &#x201c;Is there a problem?&#x201d; she asked, banishing the image.<br> <br>He laughed. &#x201c;Am I that transparent?&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s part of your charm, Val thought, but didn&#x2019;t say. Instead she said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re running late.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About half an hour.&#x201d;<br> <br>Val immediately doubled his estimate. Half an hour, Evan-time, meant at least an hour on anybody else&#x2019;s clock. &#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll tell Brianne.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tell her a problem came up that . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . has to be dealt with,&#x201d; Val finished for him, having learned the script by heart years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there as soon as I can.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell her.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll be strange,&#x201d; he added, his voice trailing off to a whisper.<br> <br>&#x201c;What will?&#x201d;<br> <br>A sigh. Then, &#x201c;Being there without you. Not celebrating your birthday together.&#x201d;<br> <br>Val said nothing. How could she speak when he&#x2019;d knocked the wind right out of her?<br> <br>&#x201c;Val?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell Brianne you&#x2019;ll be here in half an hour.&#x201d; Val hung up the phone before either of them could say another word.

As a Mardi Gras tradition in New Orleans, carnival krewes throw beads and other trinkets from floats. Often, the beads become tangled and broken. For years, children have enjoyed twisting the broken beads into animal figurines. The most popular animal to make is the dog. Various groups like Cub Scouts and Brownies make the little bead dogs and sell them for fundraising activities. In the spirit of this tradition, Haydel&#39;s has created a rendering of the old time bead dog, jazzed up for the 21st century.</p><p></p><h2>Asymmetry: Poems</h2><p><p><b>A stunning new collection from Poland&#x2019;s leading poet</b><i></i><br><i></i><br><i>Give me back my childhood,</i><br><i>republic of loquacious sparrows,</i><br><i>measureless thickets of nettles</i><br><i>and the timid wood owl's nightly sobs.</i></p><p>One of the most vibrant voices of our time, Adam Zagajewski is a modern master of the poetic form.

Though as sanguine as ever, Zagajewski often turns to elegy in this deeply powerful collection, remembering loved ones he&#x2019;s lost: a hairdresser, the philosopher Krzystzof Michalski, and, most poignantly, his parents.

From a teenager who drives a museum curator to mummify him for signing Phantom Snake (an anagram of his name) all over his exhibits, to a boy who's dared to visit the tomb of a vampire at midnight only to discover that the vampire boy he meets has a mother who nags just like his own, the eerie and chilling settings and characters will captivate readers.</p><p>A spine-chilling collection of stories from a master storyteller, featuring vampires, mummies and ghouls galore. And, like all the best tales, the troublemakers always receive a grisly comeuppance!"I sometimes think it ironic for an ex-seaman, longshoreman, truck driver, policeman, bus driver, etc., to find success writing children's novels," says Brian Jacques (pronounced "Jakes"). Yet it is all too true. With the publication of his first children's book in 1987, the award-winning <b>Redwall</b>, Jacques' fresh talent has received exceptional praise from reviewers in the United States and England. Newbery Award winner Lloyd Alexander called it "a fine work, literate, witty, filled with the excitement of genuine storytelling. Young people will surely be captivated. I hope they give their elders a chance to share the delights."<p>A well-known radio personality in his native Liverpool--as well as an actor, stand-up comic, and playwright--Brian Jacques is the host of "Jakestown" on BBC Radio Merseyside. Ever the performer, Jacques is well-known for applying his acting and entertainment background to his lively presentations to legions of young fans at schools across the United States and England.</p><p><b>Brian Jacques</b> was born in Liverpool, England on June 15th, 1939. Along with forty percent of the population of Liverpool, his ancestral roots are in Ireland, County Cork to be exact.</p><p>He grew up in the area around the Liverpool docks. His interest in adventure stories began at an early age with reading the books of: Daniel Defoe, Sir Henry Rider Haggard, Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Thomas Malory, Robert Michael Ballantyne, Robert Louis Stevenson, Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Kenneth Grahame. He attended St. John's School, an inner city school that had its playground on the roof. On his first day at St. John's, at the age of ten, he had an experience that marked his potential as a writer. When given an assignment of writing a story about animals, he wrote about the bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The teacher could not, and would not, believe that a ten year old could write that well. When young Brian refused to falsely say that he had copied the story, he was caned as "a liar". He had always loved to write, but it was only then, that he realized that he had a talent for writing.</p><p>Some teachers at St. John's proved to be good role models. As Mr. Jacques recalls:</p><p>"My favourite teacher was Mr. Austin Thomas. He looked like Lee Marvin. Big Man. A Captain in World War II. He came to school on a big bush bike with the haversack on back. He was a man's man. Always fair. I was fourteen at the time when Mr. Thomas introduced the class to poetry and Greek literature. (Because of him, I saved seven shillings and sixpence to buy <b>The Iliad</b> and <b>The Odyssey</b> at this dusty used book shop.)"</p><p>This interest in poetry extended to Wordsworth, Tennyson, and Goldsmith.It was also at St. John's that Brian met a teacher, Alan Durband (who also taught two Beatles, Paul McCartney and George Harrison), who, more than thirty years later would bring about a major change in his life.</p><p>After Brian finished school at fifteen, he set out to find adventure as a merchant seaman. He travelled to many far away ports, including New York, Valparaiso, San Francisco, and Yokohama. Tiring of the lonely life of a sailor, he returned to Liverpool where he worked as a railway fireman, a longshoreman, a long-distance truck driver, a bus driver, a boxer, a bobby (Police Constable 216D), a postmaster, and a stand-up comic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Penguin mourns the passing of celebrated children&#x2019;s book author Brian Jacques</b></p></p><h2>The Nevada test site: A guide to America&#39;s nuclear proving ground</h2><p>The only book available that describes the nation's foremost weapons and R&amp;D field test facility.

The pitiful wretches of eternal hell? We are vampires, and that is enough. I am a vampire, and that is far more than enough. I am that which must be feared, worshipped and adored. The world is mine -- now and forever. No one holds command over me. No man. No god. No prince. What is a claim of age for ones who are immortal? What is a claim of power for ones who defy death? Call your damnable hunt. We shall see whom I drag screaming to hell with me. The Guide to the Sabbat examines the Sabbat exhaustively from the antitribu, or &#34;anti-clans, &#34; that populate its ranks, to the terrifying Disciplines they use, to their methods of waging war on the Camarilla and Antediluvians alike. This book also explores the Sabbat&#39;s progress in its war effort, chronicling the Cainites&#39; inexorable spread across the East Coast and back to their usurped territories in the Old World.</p><p></p><h2>Abraham Lincoln: The War Years Vol 3</h2><p>The story of Lincoln's life from his inauguration in 1861 to his death and funeral in 1865.

He chronicles how the journalistic talent Rolling Stone attracted--including Hunter S.

As in Vavra's most popular books, all are alone and running free in glorious natural settings: a white Arabian in a sun-washed desert; a black Friesian galloping in snowdrifts; a gray Andalusian amid violet flowers; a chestnut Arabian prancing in autumn leaves.</p><p>These lush photographs are accompanied by poetry and are followed by text and drawing that profile each breed, highlighting the particularly outstanding traits of each horse depicted. Vavra pays special attention to the Andalusian, providing an essay on its romantic history.

Breathtaking in its range and erudition, it explores Shiite festivals and the English Civil war, the finger exercises of monkeys and the effects of inflation in Weimar Germany. In this study of the interplay of crowds, Canetti offers one of the most profound and startling portraits of the human condition.</p></p><p>Elias Canetti's 1981 Nobel Prize was awarded mainly on the basis of this, his masterwork of philosophical anthropology about <i>la condition humaine</i> on an overpopulated planet. <p> Ranging from soccer crowds and political rallies to Bushmen and the pilgrimage to Mecca, Canetti exhaustively reviews the way crowds form, develop, and dissolve, using this taxonomy of mass movement as a key to the dynamics of social life. The style is abstract, erudite, and anecdotal, which makes <i>Crowds and Power</i> the sort of work that awes some readers with its profundity while irritating others with its elusiveness. Canetti loves to say something brilliant but counterintuitive, and then leave the reader to figure out both why he said it and whether it's really true. <i>--Richard Farr</i></p><p><b>Elias Canetti </b>(1905-94) was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981.

The same is true for work on the atonement, which has blossomed in the last decade. Few studies attempt to connect the dots between these two theological topics, however. In this volume, respected theologian Oliver Crisp offers a fresh analytic-theological account of the person and work of Christ, focusing on the theme of union with God Incarnate. Along the way, he engages a range of contemporary and historic Christian thinkers and tackles a number of key issues in contemporary discussions. Wide-ranging and carefully argued, this unified account of the person and work of Christ will be of interest to scholars and students of Christian theology.</p><p>"Thoughtful and unfailingly generous with his many interlocutors, Oliver Crisp engages the full breadth of christological topics with an eye turned equally to traditional Christian claims and contemporary philosophical challenges to them. In its wide-ranging assessments of eternal generation, incarnation, hypostatic union, and atonement, <i>The Word Enfleshed </i>exemplifies the core values of the analytic theology movement by offering a set of theological arguments that cross established boundaries of academic discipline as well as confessional identity in the service of helping Christians give a credible account of the hope that is in them."<br>--<b>Ian A. McFarland</b>, Selwyn College, University of Cambridge<br><br>"Anyone who has followed Oliver Crisp's essays over the last few years must have suspected that even as he plies analytical tools to work on particular, local puzzles in theology, he is taking his bearings from a fairly comprehensive account of Christian doctrine. <i>The Word Enfleshed</i> confirms that suspicion. The chapters of this book are focused on issues sharply defined enough to be manageable, yet when assembled they amount to a well-connected doctrinal system, at least in outline. Crisp continues his defense of a Christology that has a traditional profile, meanwhile extending his argument into soteriology, anthropology, and pneumatology."<br>--<b>Fred Sanders</b>, Torrey Honors Institute, Biola University<br><br>"In an era where academic theology is succumbing to specialization and fragmentation, Crisp offers us a compelling account of the integration of the person and work of Christ. This is a work of retrieval from the ancient church, as well as a recovery of the catholicity of Reformed thought."<br>--<b>Julie Canlis</b>, Regent College<br><br>"This is analytic theology at its christological best. Crisp is profoundly sensitive to the historical traditions and contemporary debates. He explores and defends central themes on the life and work of Christ with humor, deftness, and deep insight. He never relinquishes rigor, precision, and a sense of the necessary development of models and conceptualities to confess orthodox creeds and a high Christology. This work continues to establish Crisp as a major modern christological thinker for both philosophers and theologians."<br>--<b>Gavin D'Costa</b>, University of Bristol<b>Oliver D. Crisp </b>(PhD, King's College, University of London) is professor of systematic theology at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, California.

Putting the backside front and center. &#34;The Kama Sutra&#34; gives detailed instructions on how to spank it. Contemporary Italians touch it for luck before placing a bet. Americans are having it cosmetically enhanced at rates approaching breast enlargement surgery. The female butt, tush, culo, or derriere has always inspired awe, fantasy, and slavish devotion. Curiously, its primary purpose is functional rather than aesthetic: butts balance our bodies while running, according to biologists. But ask any pygophiliac - as fundament fans are clinically termed - and you&#39;ll get the same answer: female hindquarters exist to please the eye, the hands, and parts south. A pert posterior causes instant arousal, as Zora Neale Hurston observed in &#34;Their Eyes Were Watching God&#34;: &#39;The men noticed her firm buttocks like she had grape fruits in her hip pockets&#39;. Or, as rapper Sir Mix-a-lot proclaimed, &#39;My anaconda don&#39;t want none, unless you&#39;ve got buns, hun&#39;. Having all but disappeared from western culture in the breast-obsessed second half of the 20th century, the fully formed fanny is currently enjoying a massive resurgence, attributed by some to American actress Jennifer Lopez, by others to the rise of booty-centric hip hop culture. Yet this rage for shapely butts is nothing new.

What would you think? You may be asking yourself, Why do they want to film me? Is this a joke or some sort of golf reality show? Then, what if one of the sportscasters puts a microphone in front of your face and asks, &#x201c;Are you mentally strong?&#x201d; How would you reply? Would you look directly into the camera and say, &#x201c;Yes, absolutely!&#x201d; Or would you be more reserved and hesitant? Would you need a bit of time to think it over before you gave your answer? What if they asked the question in a different way: &#x201c;Do you ever make mental mistakes when you play golf?&#x201d; Now what would your answer be? <br>If you replied to the first question that you are mentally strong, then good for you. Having a self-concept that brims with self-confidence is vital to playing consistently well. But the majority of us tend to be a bit more restrained in our estimation of our golf worth. It&#x2019;s not that we don&#x2019;t value our talent, but we know firsthand that golf is a tough game to play in general and especially at a high level of consistency. Humility tends to be learned on the course via the school of hard knocks and unexpected results. So, our guttural response is going to be a bit guarded due to the challenging nature of the game itself. <br>However, in response to the second question, many of us fess up and admit to making mental errors. We all realize that in our golfing lives we are not bulletproof or invincible. We have all asked ourselves when playing the best round of our lives, Will I be able to close the deal? Will I be able to hang on and finish well? Is today the day that I succeed? These questions of doubt and suspicion rule our innermost thoughts and desires. We have all faced these demons, and sometimes we succeed and other times we fail. But when we fail, the fallout from the emotional devastation is more lasting on our psyches than the joys of the minor victories. <br>Let me ask you one more question: How many times have you said to yourself &#x201c;that was stupid&#x201d; or &#x201c;I just wasn&#x2019;t into it&#x201d; or &#x201c;I just knew that was going to happen&#x201d; immediately after a poor shot? (Think about that one for a minute.) The point I am trying to make is, if you could eliminate every mental mistake or hesitation in your golfing round that led to a shot below your ability, how much better could you be? I imagine you would say much better! That is what playing mentally strong golf is all about. It is about stepping into your shot with the freedom to swing with trust and know that your ball is going to your intended target! <br>THE GREATEST INTERFERENCE: SELF-DOUBT <br>Many golfers that I have counseled over the years have told me that when they are over the ball, they feel doubt and anxiety. They are worried that they will hit a poor shot, embarrass themselves, or that others are judging them. They become &#x201c;self-aware&#x201d; rather than &#x201c;target-aware.&#x201d; That is, their mind is focused on past poor performance rather than on where it needs to be&nbsp;&#x2026; the target. These players become so immersed in their thoughts that they fail to trust their talent and second-guess their decisions. They start to hit poor shots and eventually lose confidence in themselves. These internal issues are directly linked to the mind-body connection of how thoughts affect feelings and vice versa. Even if your feelings or thoughts are unfounded, the fallout from them remains the same and creates ineffective shots and results. <br>The greatest interference that you will have in your life is not negative evaluation from others, but your self-doubt. Your doubt and the incessant worry about your ability to play the way that you expect is the greatest roadblock to your golfing success. More important, every mental mistake you make is woven directly into the doubt and fear that you carry into every shot you play. In discussing doubt and mental mistakes with golfers of all levels for this book, I often found mixed feelings about how a player interprets success, confidence, and failure. It seems all golfers have their own story to tell, and when discussing doubt and fear, they feel as if they are the only ones that feel this way. <br>Part of the odd nature of golf is that it often creates feelings of doubt and uncertainty about one&#x2019;s abilities <i>even when those talents have been honed to precision over years of practice and competition.</i> Despite knowing that doubt and indecision affect their behavior, many golfers with multiple years of experience still struggle with doubt and an inability to believe that good things will happen. They worry that bad events will happen, and they eventually sabotage their talent. They end up second-guessing themselves and before long they become mentally frustrated and lose confidence. Thus we have a multitude of golfers who stymie themselves with self-limiting thoughts and feelings even before they step onto the first tee. <br>There are as many error-producing thoughts and worries that plague golfers as there are players of this vexing game. Many of these thoughts are of failure, anxiety, and the inability to pull off a certain shot in a particular situation. Worries about whether other players will respect your swing or even acknowledge you as a good player affect your self-image and self-confidence. The following section highlights but a few of the mental errors that established players of every faction of professional and amateur golf suffer. As you read these passages, you may find yourself immersed in their words and suffering from the same calamity. <br>MENTAL ERROR REVELATIONS <br>Here are a few excerpts from some of the touring professionals and top teachers who were kind enough to share their experiences of doubt. The first is from Cameron Yancey, a young touring professional whom I coached at the University of Virginia during the 1990s. Cameron was the first player to graduate from the University of Virginia and qualify to play on the PGA Tour. Cameron discusses the frustration of losing himself when he was on tour and finding that his self-doubt and the expectations of others reinforced his concerns about his ability to play at golf&#x2019;s highest level. <br>THE MENTAL MISTAKE #1 <br>My biggest mental mistake is not staying true to myself and believing in my talent. In my rookie year on the PGA Tour, I guess I was just unprepared for the stargazing that went on and I got out of my comfort zone and got away from being Cameron Yancey. I guess I just lost my own game and was trying to be someone else, and when you do that, you are done. <br>Also, when I would miss a cut, it seemed that everyone is coming up to you and asking you what is wrong and you need to be doing this and doing that, and before long, your confidence is shot and you start to question your ability to play. It&#x2019;s as if you miss a couple of cuts and you can&#x2019;t play anymore, and I don&#x2019;t know if anyone else feels like that, but that&#x2019;s what I felt like. I mean my confidence would be shaken and then I would start trying different things and I got away from doing the things that I normally do that got me on the PGA Tour in the first place! <br>So, my mental mistake is not being me and trying to be someone else. For example, I normally draw the ball and I can control it very well. Well, when I got to the tour, there was just player after player who said, &#x201c;You need to learn how to cut it. If you don&#x2019;t learn how to fade the ball, you will be done in no time.&#x201d; Well, I listened to those guys and what happened? I screwed myself up and lost the confidence in my playing ability because I was trying to hit the ball like everyone else and I am not like anyone else. I am Cameron Yancey and I need to play like Cameron Yancey. <br>DR. BOB&#x2019;S RX FOR SUCCESS <br>Just like Cameron, many of us have a game that works well for us and brings us success. However, in trying to improve and get better, we immerse ourselves in new training procedures and abandon what it is that we do well. We start searching for other ways to do the things that we have done well, and by virtue of experimentation we end up losing ourselves and our game. In Cameron&#x2019;s case, his belief in his game and what he could do with the golf ball is what earned him the chance to play on the PGA Tour in the first place! However, Cameron was seduced by many of the common mental dilemmas that often face young players who are not familiar with or are unable to recognize mental mistakes when they appear. <br>The first mental mistake that Cameron committed was the &#x201c;stargazing&#x201d; when he first arrived on the PGA Tour. This is a very human yet overwhelming mental mistake. When you place more focus on the people around you than on taking care of number one (which is you), your concentration is off and can only lead to poor performance. One can only imagine walking onto the practice tee alongside the likes of Tiger, Phil, and Paula and knowing that you are now among players whom you had only before seen on your flat-screen TV. Talk about being out of your comfort zone! <br>This is similar to what many of us go through when we play in our local tournaments or even when we have our weekend skins game with a couple of new players. We size up our competition. We start to wonder, Do I have the ability to compete with these other players? This self-reflection often leads to speculation and doubt. Much like Walter Zembriski, Cameron needed to let go of the other players and remind himself that he had the game to compete&nbsp;&#x2026; otherwise he wouldn&#x2019;t have gotten on the tour in the first place! <br> <i>Dr. Bob&#x2019;s Rx for Success is basic: Let go of all those around you because you cannot control their games, nor can they control yours. You must understand that your game&nbsp;&#x2026; is</i> your <i>game&nbsp;&#x2026; and no one else can play or think like you.</i> The golf course and the challenge of the game is your true opponent, not the other players! So, the next time you go out to play, play the golf course with the game you have and let the name players do their thing and you will have a much better day on the course. <br>The next mistake that created doubt is that Cameron listened to the well-intended advice of other players; he got away from being true to himself and the way that he played. He wasn&#x2019;t playing Cameron Yancey golf. He talked about how other players insisted that he needed to fade the ball rather than draw the ball, which was his dominant and &#x201c;go to&#x201d; shot. Allowing others to influence his thinking and basic beliefs about his game created doubts that sent Cameron on a search mission to find something else that might work even better than what he already had. But what happened isn&#x2019;t what Cameron intended at all; it only heightened the problem. <br>Think about what Cameron experienced and put yourself in his shoes. If everyone around you is asking, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you? Why aren&#x2019;t you playing well?,&#x201d; how would you react? If all that is being said to you creates a question mark in your mind and is constantly being hammered into your head&nbsp;&#x2026; eventually you will start to doubt yourself and begin looking into the mirror and asking, What is wrong with <i>me</i>? <br>What Cameron learned from this experience is the ultimate life lesson we must all learn: we are individuals. No one else on this golfing planet is the same or thinks the same as ourself. We must disallow the good intentions of others and stay true to our gut instincts and do our own thing. In trying to be perfect or to play like other golfers, we often give up our personal genius and end up losing ourselves and our self-confidence. As the old saying goes, &#x201c;no one is more qualified at being you&nbsp;&#x2026; than you!&#x201d; <br>I am not saying that self-improvement and searching for excellence is a bad thing, because we are all striving to improve our technical, mental, and physical abilities in golf. But when you alter or make compromises that interfere with the innate and developed talents that have taken you to a high level, then you must assess thoroughly if change is warranted. The Cameron Yancey story is vital to understanding that to be truly self-confident, you must assess your talent, believe in yourself, and learn to dismiss the good intentions of others who want you to change and be untrue to your real self. Remember, all that you have is yourself, but that should be more than enough if you truly believe in your ability. <br>THE MENTAL MISTAKE #2 <br>The second example of the mental mistake of doubt and a poor belief system comes from South African Deanne Pappas. Sometimes our most egregious golfing mistakes come about from lost opportunities or having failed in the past. The emotional fallout from these miscues causes us to worry whenever we face similar situations again. Deanne faces his greatest mental challenge on the putting green: <br>I guess my biggest mental mistake would have to be that I question my ability to be a good putter, and I know that over the years I have had a lot of success. It is a funny thing, but I am over the putt now and I am thinking after I hit a good putt and the ball is halfway to the hole, I am talking to myself and saying, &#x201c;How am I going to get screwed out of this one!&#x201d; Now what is that all about? <br>I don&#x2019;t know how I got to this position in my career, but I know that I have a good stroke because everyone tells me, &#x201c;Wow, you have such a good stroke and the ball rolls so well,&#x201d; but I think&nbsp;&#x2026; if that is true, how come I am always missing the putt? I make great rolls but the ball doesn&#x2019;t go into the hole. It just becomes so frustrating after a while and it wears your confidence in putting way down. <br>DR. BOB&#x2019;S RX FOR SUCCESS <br>Worry and doubt seem most clearly evidenced in golf on the putting green. This is because putting is black-and-white. Either you make the putt or you miss. The golf ball does not discriminate nor does it play favorites. The golf ball does not care how much you want to make the putt or how scared you are of missing. You cannot hide from your lack of belief in your putting ability because the ball will not lie. It only goes where your mind is focusing. If you fear missing, then that is what you create in your mind, and your body will respond to that directive. Hence, you putt and you miss. If you feel confident and self-assured that you can putt well, you will hit your putt solidly and it has a good chance to go in. <br>From his statements, Deanne is making the mental mistake of sabotaging his success even before his ball has finished rolling! Deanne may not perceive it, but through the years he has perhaps talked himself into the habit of reacting negatively to his putting. By instantly reacting to the feel of the putt before it finishes, he dismisses all of the positive memories from years past and the affirmations that he has received from people who tell him that he has a great stroke. <br>Interestingly, he has a history of success on the greens, but <i>even with his success, he is still finding ways to undermine his belief that he is a good putter!</i> This situation needs a fix and fast! If you share Deanne&#x2019;s problem, then here are two things that you need to do: <br>1. First, you need to suspend evaluation and judgment by the result. That is, you need to develop the philosophy that a putt is not good or bad because of the result, but should be judged by your overall commitment to and execution of the stroke of the ball. You must place more emphasis on your commitment to your read and to the execution of a good s...</p><h2>Set the Boy Free</h2><p>1st Century hardcover 2016 1st print fine condition book in fine condition dw In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Johnny Marr is a musician and songwriter.

What are all those different instruments and how do they all play just the right note at just the right time? In this fact-filled and entertaining picture book, Bruce Koscielniak gives us a lively look at the history of the orchestra and all the instruments that make up this wonderful gathering of sound. From the &#34;tooter, strings and beaters&#34; of the 1600s to the keyboard synthesizers of today, this playful exploration follows the developments and trends of music and instruments over the past four hundred years.</p><p>Bruce Koscielniak is the author and illustrator of several books for children; he is also a musician who has played the violin and jazz guitar for many years. He lives in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts.HInformed and lively, Koscielniak's (Hear, Hear, Mr. Shakespeare) fact-filled excursion through music history is just the ticket for budding musicians and music-lovers at large. Deceptively breezy prose and pictures trace the various eras in the development of the modern orchestra, starting with the instrumental groups at the dawn of the 17th century ("Tooters, Strings, and Beaters") and continuing on up to the present day, with a look at synthesizers and computer sound modules. At the same time, Koscielniak explains the evolution of musical styles (Baroque, Romantic, Classical, etc.). He also clues in readers as to how various instruments have changed over the centuries, examining such intriguing instruments as the sackbut (early trombone) and shawm (a forerunner of the oboe), as well as more familiar ones ("Kettledrums: Putting the Bomp Bomp Bah Bomp in the Orchestra"). Such important historical figures as Bach, Haydn, Duke Ellington and violin craftsman Antonio Stradivari are also introduced. Koscielniak expertly integrates text and art to convey all this information; the pages are busy but not cluttered, piquing interest with carefully selected detail. Close-up sketches show, for instance, a bassoon's double reed or how a piston valve works on a brass instrument. Watercolor wash in muted earth-toned shades bolsters the assured ink drawings, which seem both precise and spontaneous. Endpapers display a rogue's gallery of instruments, grouped by type and period.

Jessy, a cowhand's daughter, grew up on the ranch and shares a love for the land with Ty and Ty's father, Chase. The one obstacle to the family's continued prosperity is a 10,000-acre parcel of government land that lies within the ranch boundaries; negotiations for clear title are stalled in political wrangling between cattlemen and environmentalists. Jessy's nemesis is Tara, the glamorous daughter of rich industrialist E.J. Dyson, who was Ty's first wife.

Forced to downscale, Allmen inhabits the garden house of his former Zurich estate, attended by his Guatemalan butler, Carlos. When not reading novels by Balzac and Somerset Maugham, he plays jazz on a Bechstein baby grand. Allmen&#x2019;s fortunes take a sharp turn when he meets a stunning blonde whose lakeside villa contains five Art Nouveau bowls created by renowned French artist �mile Gall� and decorated with a dragonfly motif. Allmen, pressured to pay off mounting debts, absconds with the priceless bowls and embarks on a high-risk, potentially violent bid to cash them in. This is the first of a series of humorous, fast-paced detective novels devoted to a memorable gentleman thief who, with his trusted sidekick Carlos, creates an investigative firm to recover missing precious objects.</p></p><p>Martin Suter, born in Zurich in 1948, is a novelist, screenwriter and newspaper columnist. He has written a dozen novels, many of them best-sellers in Europe and translated into 32 languages. Suter lives with his family in Zurich.

He has translated the diaries of East German writer Brigitte Reimann as well as nonfiction books about Joseph Beuys and Pina Bausch, and has been a translator in residence at the Europ�ische �bersetzer-Kollegium, in Straelen, Germany.<p>Allmen habitually rested for half an hour in the afternoon. This little siesta didn't just refresh him, it also reminded him every day that he was privileged to be a man of independent means. Even after all these years, sleeping while the rest of the country was pursuing productive activity gave him a sense of enormous happiness he knew only from cutting class at school. He called it "cutting life."</p> <p>There was nothing more delicious than closing the curtains on whatever was going on outside, slipping under the cool quilt in your underwear and listening to the distant sounds of the world with half-closed eyes. Only to emerge from your afternoon snooze shortly afterward, amazed and invigorated.</p> <p>His bedroom was filled by a king-size bed, a bookshelf for his nighttime reading matter and two closets for the section of his wardrobe appropriate to the time of year. The rest of his clothes were also stored in the laundry.</p> <p>He lay in bed, next to him a paperback for the unlikely situation he was unable to doze off. The rain pattered softly against the window, otherwise the world outside kept quiet.</p> <p>He couldn't entirely banish D�rig's letter from his consciousness. Not because of the twelve thousand, four hundred and fifty five francs. He would find them somehow. It was the nature of this final demand which was disturbing him.</p> <p>However badly Allmen managed money, he was extremely good at managing debt. He had learned that during his time at Charterhouse, the exclusive boarding school in Surrey where his father had sent him at fourteen at his own request. Allmen wanted to be cleansed of his family's jumped-up farmyard whiff, as he put it.</p> <p>At Charterhouse handling debt was an unofficial part of the boys' education. Debt was nothing to be ashamed of. On the contrary, it was good for one's reputation to have some. For pedagogic reasons the school rules set a limit on the amount of pocket money pupils could be given. This led to a proliferation of money lending. Everyone boasted about their debts, looked up to those with the highest, deferred them or serviced them in installments, always paying them off with style and nonchalance. Allmen had continued this in later life. Right from the start, the income from his inheritance had failed to match his growing need for capital, and his deceased father's trustees soon lost their patience. They were succeeded by a series of handpicked advisors, whose advice contributed more to Allmen's expenses than his income. He soon found himself forced to finance his lifestyle and his new acquisitions&#x2015; alongside the Villa Schwarzacker these included apartments in Paris, London, New York, Rome and Barcelona&#x2015; by parting with some of the more secure, solid assets his father had bequeathed him. And when he had used up that supply, he maintained himself via sales&#x2015;mostly rash&#x2015;of his new acquisitions, first the real estate, then furniture, then collector's items, then one by one the decreasing number of items which in his former life he had considered indispensible. And finally items acquired in a similar manner to the Kangxi vase.</p> <p>As a rich man, Allmen had been a highly generous creditor. And now in his role as debtor, he expected the same patience and understanding from his creditors. Initially he was not disappointed. His former solvency stood him in good stead. What he had were not debts; they were outstanding payments, accounts, pending items. Creditor and debtor treated each other with the respect everyone owes someone they are dependent on.</p> <p>And this was why D�rig's letter had opened up a new dimension. It was a crude, vulgar fit of rage from a man prepared to use violence, a category he had not yet encountered. Allmen abhorred all forms of violence. Including the verbal form.</p> <p>He was seriously perturbed. But when he woke half an hour later from his siesta, amazed and refreshed as ever, this perturbation had receded into something quiet and distant.</p></p><h2>Detection, Estimation and Modulation Theory - Part II: Nonliner Modulation Theory</h2><p>DETECTION, ESTIMATION, AND MODULATION THEORY, PART II, NONLINER MODULATION THEORY-Wiley-HARRY L.

Traditional Haggadah with Original Commentary</h2><p>This fascinating guide to the inner journey offered by the Passover Seder evening incorporates a holistic approach to Judaism, which activates the four worlds of the individual: the world of action, the world of emotion, the world of intellect, and the world of spirit. It weaves a beautiful tapestry, illuminating the treasures available within Passover and the Jewish yearly festival cycle.</p><p><p><b>Michael L. Kagan</b> is a teacher of holistic Judaism and an ordained <i>maggid</i>, or sacred storyteller. He is the author of <i>God&#x2019;s Prayer</i> and <i>The King&#x2019;s Messenger: A Parable about Judaism</i>.</p>"How is this night different from all other nights?" is the traditional Passover question. But Kagan (who describes himself as an "ortho-practicing, but unorthodox, Jew") wants seder participants to look beyond the obvious and ask themselves a different question: "How will this night change me?" Using the Exodus story as an allegory of an individual's spiritual slavery and redemption, Kagan advocates a holistic approach to Judaism that merges the worlds of action, emotion, intellect and spirit. Readers are asked to reflect upon what is keeping them enslaved in their "inner Mitzraim" (Egypt). Kagan spiritualizes the various elements of Passover observance; burning the hametz (leavened bread), for example, symbolizes a willingness to let go of attachments and anything that puffs us up. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The result is a tragicomic tour de force, an upside-down roadmap to everyone's inner Sodom, a perversely moral (and morally perverse) masterpiece by a modern-day Marquis de Sade.</p><p>Alfred Chester was, in the words of Gore Vidal, &#34;a glorious writer, tough as nails.&#34; His other books include The Exquisite Corpse (Black Sparrow Books, 2004), Head of a Sad Angel (stories, 1990), and Looking for Genet (essays, 1992). Born in Brooklyn in 1928, he died in Tel Aviv in 1971.Sometimes brutal and hilariously waspish, but always humane. --Sam Jordison, Guardian Unlimited (UK)</p><h2>The Sea and the Mirror: A Commentary on Shakespeare&#39;s The Tempest (W.H. Auden: Critical Editions)</h2><p><p>Written in the midst of World War II after its author emigrated to America, "The Sea and the Mirror" is not merely a great poem but ranks as one of the most profound interpretations of Shakespeare's final play in the twentieth century. As W. H. Auden told friends, it is "really about the Christian conception of art" and it is "my Ars Poetica, in the same way I believe <i>The Tempest</i> to be Shakespeare's." This is the first critical edition. Arthur Kirsch's introduction and notes make the poem newly accessible to readers of Auden, readers of Shakespeare, and all those interested in the relation of life and literature--those two classic themes alluded to in its title.</p><p>The poem begins in a theater after a performance of <i>The Tempest</i> has ended. It includes a moving speech in verse by Prospero bidding farewell to Ariel, a section in which the supporting characters speak in a dazzling variety of verse forms about their experiences on the island, and an extravagantly inventive section in prose that sees the uncivilized Caliban address the audience on art--an unalloyed example of what Auden's friend Oliver Sachs has called his "wild, extraordinary and demonic imagination."</p><p>Besides annotating Auden's allusions and sources (in notes after the text), Kirsch provides extensive quotations from his manuscript drafts, permitting the reader to follow the poem's genesis in Auden's imagination. This book, which incorporates for the first time previously ignored corrections that Auden made on the galleys of the first edition, also provides an unusual opportunity to see the effect of one literary genius upon another.</p></p><p><p>"It is wonderful to have this new edition of <i>The Sea and the Mirror</i>, which I have always considered Auden's greatest work written in America and certainly one of the summits of his career. The long speech of Caliban, channeling Henry James, is in itself a marvelment."--<b>John Ashbery</b></p><p>"The most significant of all Auden's unpatriotic Shakespearean forays of the 1940s, <i>The Sea and the Mirror</i> is a work of enormous skill, learning, and intelligence, a stylistic tour de force that is also freakish, polemical, confessional, and open-ended. It is a poem that comes much nearer to being a major salvo in Auden's cultural war with Little Englandism than it does to being the modest academic 'commentary' that on the title page it rather deviously declares itself to be. Arthur Kirsch's edition of this work is a fine addition to the canon of Auden scholarship. This book will fascinate all readers of Auden, and of Shakespeare."--<b>Nicholas Jenkins</b></p><b>Arthur Kirsch</b>, Alice Griffin Professor of English Emeritus at the University of Virginia, is the editor of <i>Auden's Lectures on Shakespeare</i> (Princeton).</p><h2>Sand in my shoe: Homestead days in Twentynine Palms</h2><p>Twentynine Palms, California 1978 first edition.

Salinger wrote one of the most famous books ever written, The Catcher in the Rye. Salinger wrote many stories and, in 1941, after several rejections, Salinger finally cracked The New Yorker, with a story, &#34;Slight Rebellion Off Madison,&#34; that was an early sketch of what became a scene in &#34;The Catcher in the Rye.&#34; The magazine then had second thoughts in part because of World War II in which Salinger was in combat, and held the story for five years before finally publishing it in 1946, buried in the back of an issue. Everyone was surprised when the story and the book that followed it became a bit hit. Even today nobody can really explain why Catcher in the Rye is so famous and so popular. Yet, millions have been sold and are still being sold even though only available as used books nowadays. When The Catcher in the Rye was published in 1951, it was registered for copyright as &#34;additional material.&#34; This obviously referred to the earlier work &#34;Slight Rebellion Off Madison.&#34; The copyright page on &#34;The Catcher in the Rye&#34; states &#34;Copyright 1945, 1946, 1951 by J. D Salinger.&#34; The date of 1945 obviously refers to the publication of &#34;I&#39;m Crazy,&#34; a short story written by Salinger and published in the December 22, 1945 issue of Collier&#39;s magazine that first introduced the character Holden Caulfield to the reading public. Salinger later reworked this short story to incorporate it into The Catcher in the Rye. The two earlier stories are &#34;I&#39;m Crazy,&#34; an early version of Holden&#39;s departure from prep school that later shows up in The Catcher in the Rye. With minor alteration, much of this story is familiar to readers as the chapter where Holden visits Mr. Spencer. What sets this story apart is the presence of an additional Caulfield sister and the clarity of Holden&#39;s resignation and compromise at the end. &#34;Slight Rebellion off Madison&#34; is an early version of another scene in The Catcher in the Rye. The story follows Holden when he is home from Pency and goes to the movies, then skating with Sally Hayes, followed by his drunken calls to her apartment late at night. An early story, it is the first of Salinger&#39;s Caulfied works to be accepted for publication.</p><p>Since his debut in 1951 as <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, Holden Caulfield has been synonymous with "cynical adolescent." Holden narrates the story of a couple of days in his sixteen-year-old life, just after he's been expelled from prep school, in a slang that sounds edgy even today and keeps this novel on banned book lists. It begins,<br> <p> "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them." </p><p> His constant wry observations about what he encounters, from teachers to phonies (the two of course are not mutually exclusive) capture the essence of the eternal teenage experience of alienation.</p>J D Salinger was born in 1919. He grew up in New York City, and wrote short stories from an early age, but his breakthrough came in 1948 with the publication in The New Yorker of &#39;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&#39;. The Catcher in the Rye was his first and only novel, published in 1951. It remains one of the most translated, taught and reprinted texts, and has sold some 65 million copies. It was followed by three other books of short stories and novellas, the most recent of which was published in 1963. He lives in Cornish, New Hampshire.</p>
